            I’ve always had fantastic experiences with ASOS. I have ordered more than I would like to admit and every single time the ASOS order is timely and perfect! Returning items has always been hassle free, usually the money goes into my account very quickly after I’ve returned them.

            Wow, didn't realise so many people had also had bad experiences with ASOS. My story: Fairly expensive item arrived damaged, with the item out of stock I was offered no other option than to return the item at my inconvenience, would have kept the item but do not expect clothes to arrive damaged and the customer service stance was unsatisfactory. Poor job from ASOS all round here, damaged item, poor customer service, couldn't be much more dissapointed. sorry

            They were three days late for a next day delivery. I complained and they said I could go and collect it from the depot 45 minutes away if I needed it quick, I did. Got to the depot and they told me Asos we’re lying to me. I ended up driving for over one and a half hours because ASOS customer service lied to get me off their back. Completely despicable customer service.

Told me there’s nothing they could do even tho the address was in a different city and the house is now unoccupied, meaning the box will just be left to rot or be stolen. I asked if I could confirm credit card info etc to change the address but nothing. It hasn’t even shipped yet! Horrible.

            ASOS is THE WORST. Their customer service is terrible, you pay for express shipping, and then the item takes a full week and a half longer than promised to ship, they don't do anything to make these situations right, and their customer service agents are useless robots. Avoid at all costs. Modcloth, Lulu's, J Crews, etc.  - ALL better than ASOS. Will never shop here again. No wonder they make it impossible for customers to leave reviews.

            I ordered 2 dresses with a promo 15% off discount. One of the dresses (made by asos) was poorly made and didn't fit well, so I returned it and kept the other one.Obviously GCSE Maths is not a requirement for the people processing returns, and instead of refunding the cost of one dress minus 15%, they also deducted the 15% discount of the dress that I wanted to keep, meaning that my refund was less than it should be.I informed them immediately, even telling them the exact amount I should have been refunded, because I was certain they could not work it out on their own. I was told that they had issued the refund shortfall and it would be back in my account in 10 working days. 11 working days later, and no refund. After enquiring several times and being reassured that it was being refunded back to my paypal, they have now admitted that they LIED, and no refund was issued to paypal because they apparently can't process the refund that way!Now I'm being told that if I want my money back (erm, of course) I have to add my card details on their site and wait god knows how long for the refund. They were not apologetic about lying to me and making me wait several weeks for MY MONEY. This was their mistake, but they couldn't care less. I will not shop with them again.

            Literally the worst company! I ordered a pair of shorts for my partner, waited ages for a dispatch email, I contacted them on Instagram to be ignored and then suddenly I received the dispatch email. When we got them they were like child’s size shorts so had to send them back, they received the item (as I tracked on Royal Mail site) but didn’t notify me, so I contacted them on instagram to be ignored again, so I went on the Asos chat and they said it can take up to 7 working days, however they hadn’t even sent an email to say they had them! They also only refund the item and not the postage which other sites do! Waste of time, There are far better sites and they actually respond!

            This is by far the worst company i have ever encountered. My order was supposed to be a 2 day shipping but 12 days later the products never arrived. When i contacted the carrier, they informed me the package arrived to them empty. I immediately contacted ASOS and they told me i needed to wait 10 more days before they could help me. Every time I attempted to chat with customer service to inform them that the carrier had advise me to contact them, all they could say was for me to keep waiting like i was going to miraculously get a package that the carrier never even got. After the extra 10 days, all they could say was you need to allow us 24 hours to see what we can do for you. This is insane. I ended up with no products and no money. They literally stole my money and refuse to refund me.Please, don’t ever buy from this company.

And I received my refund email just 13 hours later at 12 a.m. on Tuesday.Regarding the clothing, I don't like the way it smells. Sometimes, it has a perfumey smell. Other times, some of the faux leathers have a fishy smell.

            I bought a pair of size US 13 shoes online and I live in Canada, the shoes arrived after the established date and it came in the wrong size! It came size 12 so I started talking to an attendant on asos website chat, a very rude attendant. She told me that I had to pay to return the shoe since they are an UK brand so the size 12 is right because I have to adapt it to american size. But in the website and in the shoes there's nothing about UK sizes and all my life I bought US 13 sizes from different brands and I never had a problem before. It came written in the shoes 12 just that and on the website i bought size US 13! I tried to talk to her because the shoes won't fit me and I paid $36 dollars plus taxes for the shoes and to return it costs almost $25 dollars and they won't refund the price of shoe for me if I don't pay to return it but it was their mistake!!! The attendant was extremely rude to me and I'm shocked that a big company like ASOS hire people like her to help costumers, besides that the costumer is always right and I just can't believe ASOS policies in returning something that came wrong!

            I have used ASOS as my first choice of online shopping since 2000!!!! Yes all the way back when ASOS was As Seen On Screen!!! The last 12 months though things have gone from bad to worse and I finally give up. First there was the end of the ASOS VIP rewards, that they said would be replaced with a new reward system but never was, I spend ££££££ with ASOS so used to get plenty of rewards. Then there was the constant Hermes delivery debacles. Delivery times have got longer and longer if you don’t pay for overnight delivery to the point I have to plan a month in advance what I want to purchase. Which defeats the whole convenience aspect of online shopping. And now I have sent two separate returns and items that I returned are missing from the refunds and I cannot get a straight answer from anyone as ASOS. I have literally spent thousands of pounds with ASOS. (On average £200 a month for nearly 20 years!!!!!) but unfortunately they won’t be receiving any more of my hard earned cash. Poor delivery, poor returns process now and no rewards I’d rather spend elsewhere. Shame because I was a loyal customer for two decades.

            When I saw all these bad reviews I was truly astonished! I started shopping at ASOS when a friend told me they have an ok returns policy. I have collected two orders from them so far and everything seems to be fine. The size guide is also a good way to determine your size. The only instance when it didn't work was on an Oasis dress but my lack of boobs seemed to be the problem there. There are certainly problems with ASOS being a fast-fashion distributor, but while my budget is limited -  ASOS is one of the best ways to clothe myself :)

            I am very annoyed and disappointed as I placed an order on 1st August following a flash 20% sale offer notification. The order total was £39 and then with a discount of £67 became £271. I had received a notification that my order would be delivered to a parcel shop as requested on Saturday 3rd August.On the morning of Saturday 3rd August I received an email from DPD stating my parcel would not be delivered but instead would be sent back to ASOS and I should contact them for more information. I called ASOS at 8am to find out what happened, the advisor explained he was not ure but guessed usually in this instance the parcel was damaged in transit. He advised the money would be refunded to me once they received the items. I told him I did not want a refund just for them to send the items! He then explained unfortunately I would need to reorder these items. I asked about the great saving I had made, which was my reasoning for placing a large order and he explained ASOS were unable to guarantee I could get the 20% off again.I was quite upset by this as none of this is my fault and I think it would be only fair that ASOS honour the discount I had given the delivery issue was nothing to do with me. He said he would put a note on the account. I then called back in the few hours later to find out if there was any update as to what did happen to my parcel. The advisor I spoke to this time kept me waiting for 10 minutes on the line whilst she contacted DPD to try and find out and speak to the depot. The advisor came back to me and informed me the parcel was too big for the parcel shop they were delivering to so it was being returned. On speaking with the depot she could try and get it redirected to my home address, but would need to send an email. She advised me once it had been picked up by the DPD depot I would receive an email regarding my order.I waited for 4 hours and called back as I ahd not recived an email – of course, why would I expect a response. Where I have made complaints previously I have gotten responses from advisors repeating the same information and very unhelpful. On my 3rd call to ASOS on the afternoon of 3rd August I was told the DPD depot had not received the information in time and that it had been sent back to ASOS. I asked why was I not informed, again the advisor apologised. One apology after another. At this point I aked about the discount and can the order be replaced and I get the discount added over the phone and pay. I was told this could not be done and they would need to request a promotion code from the promotion team, which can take 48 hours for them to respond. It has now been 24 hours and I have not received any email to update me, though I will wait for 48 hours to pass – I am doubtful I will be contacted. How can one order be so much hassle. The fact that ASOS as a company cannot guarantee me the discount I originally had for an order that was messed up through no fault of my own is pretty poor.Most retailers would apologise for the hassle and try and help, offer compensation or send you a discount code - but no...not ASOS!I have the premier delivery pass but have problems usually with Hermes and any other orders due for a Sunday delivery...i.e. they won't arrive until the Monday/Tuesday. I will soon stop using them altogether

            Worst customer service advisor. Called to ask her when my parcel would be coming as once again whenever a delivery is due from Hermes on a Sunday it never comes. So I explained to her that Hermes said it would be coming between 11-13. It got to 12 something and the tracking said sorry there has been a delay, we will get your parcel to you as soon as possible. It got to 14:40 and the parcel hadn't arrived so I contacted Asos and asked them to chase the parcel, the lady was very short on the phone talking with an attitude as if she was fed up. She put me on hold to see what had happened and then came back saying that they already attempted delivery I tried to explain this to her that this always happens on a Sunday with Hermes they send message saying delays and you wait for it to come and then suddenly they just send another message saying the tried to deliver bit no one at home, blatant lie once again. Tried to explain this to Customer Service but she wasn't interested just kept saying that's what they have said in a snap way, I left the call feeling as if she was accusing me of lying about being in waiting. So disappointed with Asos. Maybe they don't care as I have the 1 year next day delivery plan so they know they don't have to repay the delivery charge everytime Hermes don't deliver. DPD always deliver when they say they will. Curious if other have this problem in their area as I know others from my area have the same problem with hermes

            Still waiting for my shoes :( Ordered them on July 2, with an expected delivery date of July 24/25.  Chatted with the customer service folks several times since the 25th  (they can't tell me where the shoes are because there is no tracking). The last chat was epic - after 30 min. of going back and forth and trying to resolve this, they bascially wrote this (excerpt of the transcript):""[11:27:22] ASOS have ended the chat[11:27:22] As I have said we are unable to do this - I have now advised all I can. I'm going to close the chat now. You can get a transcript of this chat emailed over to you by clicking the envelope in the top right-hand corner. Your chat reference number is 21440868 in case you need it for future reference. I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day."" I get that sometimes deliveries go awry and it's not anyone's fault, but the way I was treated pretty much ensured that I will not be coming back to shop here again. Hopefully these BAD reviews gets someone at the top of the ASOS food chain to pay attention.

            I am a big fan of ASOS and never had any issues, but this one is just unacceptable! I ordered my order June 28th and it arrived July 12th, thats two weeks after. But the late arrival is not the worst part. When it hadn’t arrived July 5th as promised, I went on their live chat to hear where it was and I specifically wrote “if it hasn’t left your warehouse, just take it back and give me a refund. I don’t need the dresses anymore”. And the lady so kindly wrote that I wasn’t there and it has been send - which was wired since I haven’t gotten any tracking number or mail about it’s departure - but she told me to wait until the 12th, so I did. The 11th I woke up to a mail saying “you’re package has left our warehouse and is on its way to you”. When I go that message I must admit I felt so lied to, she told me they didn’t have it? And when it arrived next day I got the feeling that they first send it after I wrote them. So I went on the chat again and complained about the lie. They could have just owned up to the mistake and said “sorry to hear so, here is a compensation or something”. But no no, he wrote “sorry to hear, but there is nothing I can do - you have to sent it back to us”. This whole experience has been so disappointing and I must say I am quite furious, sitting back here with no compensation of or explanation on why they lied to me. So this is minus 5 stars in my eyes and I will not place an order there one more time.

            I love ASOS but I can't stand their choice of delivery company. Hermes is the worst. All of the good things about ASOS are completely ruined by Hermes. And what's the point of paying for next day delivery if it's not gonna be delivered the next day. If ASOS were still with DPD, I'd give them 5/5

            Never deliver my items on time and for the overpriced clothes you sell I would of thought you would at least be able to afford a better delivery company. Charging so much for next day deliver and not delivering. I'll stick to my other more reliable online shopping websites.

            Never again am I ordering something from this company . I placed my order to be shipped, express (cost $20 extra). Long story short the  Carrier  knocked  On my door to deliver it but ASOS also charges customs fees which was an extra $36 that I wasn’t aware of. I refuse to pay the extra charges cause I was notified of it. So they took my package back. So I msg customer care, they told me that I have to pay the extra charges and that they can’t do anything for me. I requested a return and they said that I would have to pay the extra charges first then pay to return it again. This is f****++* Ridiculous. Don’t shop on their website they have gotten  fees.

            Please AVOID!!!!!!!My husband ordered from Asos on the 30th pf July and paid almost 8 pounds for evening next day delivery (18:00-22:00). So today, 31st of July we were home waiting for the delivery. At 21:31 he received a text saying that the parcel has been delivered to our address and signed by my husband. Shocking!!!! Nobody knocked on our door!!!!! I went on live chat to asos. The lady who I was chatting was not helpful at all. I contacted the delivery company On the dot(subcontracted by city sprint). No answer!!!!! I called CitySprint. The robot said that the call is charging 7 POUNDS per minute. I was so angry and all I just wanted was soembody to pick up the phone to explain me what's going on. I spoke to an advisor. He wanted me to put me on hold while he was trying to call the courier. I told him not to take long because they are expensive and charging 7 pounds per minute. He was telling me that in no way they're charging that amount of money and that the robot is lieing. He said he will call me back. I waited 15 minutes and he didn't call me back. I called him back and he told me that he couldn't contact the driver that his phone is off. He transfered me to a department which whould be able to help me. I spoke with one guy who was saying that he can't help me. I am not playing when I am treated like this, when I am a customer I want to get what I paid for. I was told that the courier might have not been able to deliver it so my package was returned on the depot. He tried to call the courier...there was only voicemail. I asked him why do we pay a certain delivery method and we are not getting our package? He said he doesn't know. I asked him... if for any reason the courier is unable to deliver when it is supposed to deliver, why does he send text saying that the parcel has been delivered and signed for? He said he doesn't know. It is a joke. Please avoid at all costs!!!! Will never order from ASOS again as long as they use this useless courier company. Please go to stores for shopping and avoid having items delivered by this company. Customer service does not exist!!!! I am so angered by the treatment and the incompetence.

I ordered a cute bikini for $58 CAD on sale and thought it was a good deal with the coupon and they ended up sending me the WRONG bikini, wrong size and wrong style completely!!!! And now the worst part is they want me to spend $23 bucks on return shipping, essentially paying $$$ for NOTHING.

            So here is my story (similar to several others who wrote a review here): I placed an order on 11th July, with expected delivery date by 22nd July. Today is 31st July and the order has not yet been shipped even. I wrote to customer service and they sent me an automated response saying I should check if order was delivered to neighbour, post office etc (this is for a package that has not even been shipped!), and that I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. I contacted them on the 5th day, but they said they would not follow up on my complaint before the END of the 5th day. So next day I contacted them again, and a few days later they responded, saying I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. This is outrageous! Are they really planning to send me an email every 5 days, asking me to wait for 5 days, until I give up and let them keep my money? I am now trying to get my money back through PayPal....Update: today (1 Aug) ASOS cancelled and refunded my order.

            Ordered a few of items through zaful, however only 3 out of the 4 items were shipped. I contacted them straight away to cancel the last item as it wouldn’t arrive in time. They told me to just let the item be shipped and then exchange it when it arrived, I told them I didn’t see the point to ship it from the US for me to ship it straight back. They agreed to cancel it and give me a refund. The items arrived, one was perfect, one was too small (incorrect sizing on the website), and the last item was incorrect (it was meant to be a one shoulder bodysuit and came as a high neck polo).

            Have used ASOS a few times and sometimes have to send things back. When I do the refunds are quick and easy and you don’t have to pay for them and you can often get free delivery when spending over a certain amount too. I bought some clothes last week and arrived yesterday and all of them fit. Was very pleased with the quality of the clothes and will of course buy from there again 😊

            So, this is my last review for asos.com. I have placed an order on 16th of July that I still haven't received. The 100 euros I have paid were deducted from my card immediately.So far - not a single email on the status of my order. Their customer care team has not responded to my email inquiry and it's been 5 days. Their chat support just told me to wait until August 4th, and if my order hasn't reached me by then - to try to write to them again. When I check the order itself out on their site it doesn't even appear to have been shipped. The initial delivery date they estimated was July 25th - that came and went.It is July 31st, I have waited for half a month for a simple pair of Reebok sneakers now. Not a single email, or an apology. Not a single case where I was proposed some sort of a voucher for future because of their mistakes and the mess the site is experiencing right now.Total shitstorm. At this point I just hope I get my money back eventually.

            Worst ever!  I ordered a sweatshirt Jan. 23rd, 2019. Still not received. Contacted the company via chat three times. They always ask me to check with post office, other people in household, neighbors and areas around porch. Duh!  I’ve done that and affirm it on each chat. They claim they will resolve the matter within 24 hours. Guess what they ask me to do? Same thing. If that had worked the first time, there would be no reason for another contact, obviously.

            The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been ordering from asos for 6 years and have never had a problem before. The past few months there has been something wrong with every order. From being sent the wrong item at the warehouse to not receiving an item at all. To speak to their customer service team is exhausting with the same scripted conversation sent over and over again. There is no understanding of the situation at all. I have paid for something which I haven't recieced and they are refusing to refund me! Order at Asos at your own risk. I certainly wont be as I'm not getting a product that I have paid for.

            After being lied to for two weeks that my order will arrive any time soon, today I receive an e-mail saying that the card issuer declined the payment. The money has been withdrawn from my account but they claim the card declined the payment (after telling me for two weeks that the dress has been sent). This company is a scam. They took my money and now claim they never received it. This will not be the end of it. I will sue if I have to.

            I have been a loyal Asos customer for years and its fair to say I have spent thousands on orders. However in the last year or two I have seen the service level continuously drop. I was constantly being sent the wrong items, barely received my delivery on the agreed date and at times receiving really  terrible quality items. Im sure i am not the only one hence the overall rates on here being 1 STAR!My advise,  as Asos resell brands go directly to the brand to get the item(s) you are want because Asos service is not worth the hassle plus if you are dealing directly with the brand you will receive better service.

            Ordered trousers in my size. Unfortunately I removed the tags before trying them on. They were far too small- the manufacturer must have a strange size guide. Asos customer support were unable to offer me anything, even the slightest discount on a larger pair as a gesture of goodwill.Look, I know this was my fault, but the trousers were expensive (£50). Would it kill them to treat customers like human beings and go beyond what is expected of them? I’d have been happy with 10% off a larger size, which is what they give students anyway. The problem with big corporations like this is that greed trumps everything else. Not buying from asos again for this reason.

            Order was placed on Saurday 27th july for a dress to be delivered amongst a few other items in light of a party tomorrow (wednesday). I selected next day delivery. It was out for delivery sunday at 10am. At 7pm an update from Hermes saying there has been a delay. Yesterday an update saying has been returned to sender. Where is my parcel? I ordered with plenty of time for my party and all customer service said is when we recieve the item back from hermes its 10 days for a refund in the meantime feel free to order again and when I mentioned I didn't have the funds.  They told me to use Klarna and pay Klarna when I am issued the refund.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told that everyone at ASOS customer care has same level of training so could not pass me onto a manager.

            Awful customer service !!!!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITE !!!!!!So,I had purchased on 11 June 2 pairs of white trainers £211 but the fit wasn't for me .Sent it back few days later , got proof of positing and parcel was delivered back to Asos on 17 June.3 weeks later after no refund was received I contacted Asos.Asos replayed:After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for your order 414791069. It’s very rare for returns to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you. In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. I have contacted them about 20 times-chat,calls,email.So, they have told me that basically I am lying and kept the parcel.I sent proof of posting and screenshot that its been delivered on 17June by them. But they have closed my account and because of that didn't want to speak to me anymore since the customer care have no more existing account with me.I asked to speak to their security team that made that decision -the answer was -they don't have email or phone number.Their head office apparently have nothing to do with the customer care.I have contacted my bank to investigate and claim my refund from this awful website.PLEASE BE AWARE :THEY WILL BLOCK YOUR ACCOUNT ,KEEP YOUR MONEY  AND ALL YOUR COMPLAINS AND EMAILS WILL BE IGNORED

            Today I received an email from ASOS saying that for my returned dress that they are giving to me an Asos gift voucher. I'm contacting asos for the third time about one dress. The first time I tried to return the dress was in May, but the dress came back to me. I contacted ASOS and they said to send again, so did I, but the dress returned to me again. Then I contacted them again and wrote this whole situation, they gave me a new label to send again and confirmed that I would get my money back. And today I received a gift voucher from asos instead of cash into my account. Then I contacted asos again and they said that they can't get my money back, because it has been later than 29 days. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT, it's post office and ASOS fault. Now i don't have a dress and money back. I don't recommend this page to anyone.

            I’ve used ASOS for over two years and quite frankly if I ever need to purchase new clothes this is my go to website. The quality of clothes is good and I found the watches really good value for money. When I first started using ASOS I was surprised at how quick the delivery was however after finding myself consistently using it I upgraded to the premium next day delivery scheme and quite frankly it’s one of the best value for money schemes out there. I highly recommend ASOS and will continue using it in the future.

            I had good experiences with Asos, and bad ones also, of course we usually recall more the bad than the good ones (welcome to being human :D) I made 4 orders so far, the first two went smooth and everything arrived as planned, the third one, was 3 jackets, one came with the wrong size, other was right and the third one I found it too big, so they told me to return and order a new one, which I did which leads to the fourth order where I order the jacket I wanted in XS, and I received a bag instead :/ I complain but they said well return it, I did and took a long time to get a refund. Since then I never order again, I get I was a bit off with 2 good experiences, 2 bad ones. I prolly will sometime soon try again.

            Customer support offer no actual help to customers rather just canned responses so they can end the chat quicker. Excuses for week+ delivery when ""1 day"" is advertised, absolute joke.

            Absolutely shocking customer service. Not willing to help at all. Ordered from Asos for the first time last week. 2 white dresses (getting married on the beach in september). Received my order. One of the dresses i recieved is wrong, however worked to my advantage because i love it. The dress i should have had was £60 the dress they sent was £44. All i wanted from them was the £16 difference back. (I know its not much but its not the point). I was very happy to keep the wrong dress and just be refunded the difference. However they will not do it and require me to send the wrong item back for a full refund. Now if i could have ordered this item again then that would have been no problem, however this dress is out of stock online therefore id send it back to never be able to order it again. Will be keeping the wrong dress as its perfect but will not be ordering from here again. Not only did they send me the wrong order in the first place but they've gained extra money from me, custome service was appauling, i must have repeated my self numerous times, only to be told the same thing over and over again, very poor understanding and listening skills ASOS and unwillingness to help a customer.

            Paid £10 for premier delivery in June and I’ve been unable to use it for 3 weeks because it’s just not showing up on my account. I’ve spoken to them multiple times only to have the same automated responses saying they’re “looking into it” and it’s being passed around to different teams but nothing is happening. After asking for my money back for the service I can’t use they’ve told me that while it’s being investigated I can’t get any kind of refund.

I send them back asking for replacement. I get told I'm getting a refund. I order the trainers again. UK 8.5. They come as US 8.5 again. I called customer service and she said she couldn't help me. The call charged me £6. She told me to just send them back like I did before and order them again. I upgraded to the next day delivery and she said I should have the shoes by tomorrow. I asked if the shoes were going to come in the right size this time. She said it was a warehouse issue and she wouldn't be able to help. Three transactions. Two refunds yet to be refunded even though I asked for replacements. Still no shoes that fit me properly. Waste of time and money. Don't bother.

            ASOS is not what it used to be, this does not concern their stock, that’s still excellent, a huge variety of labels and you will always find what you’re looking for. Their service however has drastically changed and I could just about ignore their decline because they’re one of the only companies that still send a printed return label in their orders! But once your order is placed you receive no tracking, recently it came through 10 days after I had taken delivery! But most recently I received an email from them saying that recently I had returned a ‘higher than average’ amount of orders and whilst they weren’t about to act on this they wanted to let me know that their has been a high amount of customers that have been ‘abusing’ their service and items returned were not in their original condition etc that they had located a specific number of these abusers and closed their accounts, not to worry, they weren’t doing that with mine, What am I meant to think about this? I am a 47 yr old woman who will order a few things (always in the sale) for choice and return them if they don’t suit me or THEY HAVE CLEARLY BEEN WORN BEFORE!!! three days after I received this email I received an order I had placed of bra’s, it’s hard to find a bra that fits well, so I was pleased to find that both bras fitted, however one of these bras ( a Gossard ) had absolutely been worn, it stank to high heaven of B.O and their were underarm stains when I looked closer,whilst trying it on I just began to smell this horrific B.o smell so it wasn’t like it was unnoticeable, well someone re-packed it and thought it was good enough to send out!! The thing is, I kept the bra, despite it’s condition, because it was on sale, Gossard is a good make and it fit me!! That’s hard to find and I knew if I sent it back and asked for a replacement it would be out of stock because it was on sale,I’m not an abuser of ASOS or any other online clothes store, I have been however a victim of it on more than one occasion with ASOS but do you think I’m going to return something in the future and say I think it’s been worn? Absolutely not, because after their email to me it’s going to seem like I am guilty if I do, so therefore I close my own account with ASOS. Because I was so offended by their email, clearly pointing the finger in my direction that I no longer want to shop with them.

I really needed the dress I have ordered for a wedding, that’s why I paid extra ! I spoke to someone from customer service and she said to return the wrong dress and order the good one again! I told her I can’t do this and to send me the dress again and I will return this one. They refused! I’m so upset!! I asked her what do I get in return for this mistakes and she said nothing!!! Great, I’ll keep ordering that dress again and hoping to eventually get the right one.   I’m so dissapointed with this company! I will never ever order from them again!

            I don't know if anyone actually reads the messages from ASOS because I've sent 2 emails to customer care and I have been ignored like I don't exist! But IF there is anyone reading this, I would like to express my sheer displeasure in your services. I have placed orders on several items from you within the last few weeks. So far I have only received one package, 3 weeks after it was scheduled to be here. Upon opening the package I discovered that the orders were wrong. Ordered a calvin klein TOTE and PAID for a tote and instead got a cross body bag which I'm sure is of much less value!! Clothes are so pathetically small, it wouldn't fit a tooth pick, and I am a very petite woman so that says a lot! Unwearable unless I lose 10kg!! I ordered gold clips and got silver. I am dreading the arrival of my other packages as I'm certain they too will be a disappointment. I live in South Africa so the nightmare of trying to return these items won't be worth the headache. Not that I can even get hold of anyone in customer service! Keep it up, ASOS. At this rate you will be a flash in the pan company who won't exist in a year! Your clothes look beautiful on the website, the prices seem fair, I would have continued to be a loyal customer if my experience had been different but I will never again support your organisation. Quick to take the money but no attention to detail on customer orders and no customer service either. I am beyond disappointed!Ps: I only have one star because there wasn't an option to give none. I hope people learn fast and stop supporting places like this with their hard earned money.

            If I could give it less I would! Ordered a few items on the 19th July and was told they would be delivered by 24th July and no later. The day came and went. I contacted ASOS to be told that there has been a delay and I now need to wait until the 2nd August and they can't do anything until then. Absolutely ridiculous customer service. There are no answers to queries and it seems they couldn't care less once they have your money. I used to love ASOS but this has made me think very differently.Side note: I ordered a parcel on the 21st July and that one has arrived so who knows where the first one is!

            Ordered last year, a week in advance for some items to arrive for a festival- they came 8 days later, one day too late. Then I bought something with the 'next day delivery' for a year, it came at about 9 pm but it was the next day at least. When I tried to order again with my 'one-year unlimited next day delivery' I was told I'd just purchased a one-off, despite the unlimited and one-off deliveries being the same price (£7.99). Thought it was a bit of a scam, never really had that issue with other companies before and wouldn't have paid £7.99 for one-off next day because I didn't need it urgently. Left it about 10 months before I purchased from them again, ordered some boots expected to be here today. Ordered Monday. Need them by Saturday, was told to wait until 11.59pm to contact them again, to be told they're having issues with the courier. If they told me that earlier I would have ordered the boots again, with next day delivery. Now I don't have that option, I've come to vent my opinion. Been told to wait until the 5th of August!!Their shipping has gone way downhill and I don't think I will ever be purchasing again. Deleting the app and saving myself the hassle. Wish I'd never bothered. I very rarely leave bad feedback and I understand companies make mistakes but three times now in less than a year when I've only made 3 orders? I understand it may be the courier's fault (Hermes) but don't mislead your customers by saying their items will be here on a certain day and not following through with that. The 5th of August is 2 weeks from my order date, plus I never got a shipping email, only an order confirmation. I used to always order from ASOS, they were my go-to. But now I don't honestly think I'll use them again. Disappointed and annoyed. Such a shame to see a once good company just ruin themselves, and judging by the number of bad reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks so.

            As a very regular customer ive ordered 4 item in asos on 21july and estimated delivery was on 24 july and my items was dispatched and on top of that one of the items is out of stock only when i raised concern via email that im still waiting for my items to be delivered today. I didnt get my order on 24 july...and me hoping maybe they would delivery on 25 July all together as i had another order to be delivered on that day as well which ive got them but the order pending still from 24 july...was still missing somewhere....had to email asos team and i didnt get any reply whatsoever and i had to txt via fb messenger and got a reply saying now all of my items r out of stock and now they have done the refund without even sending any email confirmation to me and im still waiting for it till now....absolutely terrible experience so far customer service so many people r involved without even reading properly...would give u so much hassle on top of hassle on its own...asos its not even was properly up to date and every ti.e order something u have to wander is it available at all.....very disappointing and very poor service and dealing with the matter......

            I’ve been shopping online with Asos for a little over two years. When they first came out with the 2-day shipping for $20 a year, it was great! However. As of late 2018 they started declining. Now I don’t get my shipments for at least 4-5 days. Which isn’t horrible, just not what I originally paid for. On a more positive note, the clothes do arrive neatly packaged and the return process is fairly easy. Video reviews and pictures of items on my IG page @TiffTheStiff

Obviously I will not need the dress is another month. My event will be over and it's a MATERNITY dress. I asked to escalate and rep said she can't. Proceeded to just close the chat window on me.

            I ordered and paid for a Levi jacket. Completely the  wrong item turned up (the only common feature was that it was a jacket) and the jacket I originally ordered has been showing as out of stock from an hour after I ordered it. Hence I have had to source from elsewhere. I query whether or not my item was ever in stock or if it was just a scam to get my payment. Having paid they are saying it will take up to three weeks to process my refund for an item they cannot supply!! When I tried to pursue this with customer services they hung up on me twice each time saying it was my responsibility to correct their error before they would refund me and there was nothing more they could do other than suspend my account if I didn't return the item. This involved a 12 mile round trip to the post office at my expense which they would not acknowledge was in any way their responsibility. First and last time I will use ASOS and their customer service is outrageously bad when their solution is not to offer anything but simply to hang up.

If you ever have an issue while ordering expect to NOT have it resolved. 3 times in one day I’ve tried to make an order from both my account and my husband’s account to NO avail.

            My order came in the wrong size and a few days later than expected. When questioned about this there was no reason behind it. I wanted next day delivery on a new order in my size, in which they couldn’t give me, bearing in mind none of this was my fault and the Asos staff had caused this issue. All they said was that I should choose next day delivery myself when I re-order at my expense. I further asked if they could give me a discount/promo code, or money back that I spent on delivery to be compensated for, however they refused. Very unhappy with the help that I received from customer care, getting no help at all. Won’t be using again.

            Let me preface this by saying I work in customer service for a company, so I’m usually really willing to compromise / give customer service teams the benefit of the doubt because they deal with A LOT OF CRAP. BUT, that being said, ASOS customer service SUCKS!! One of my orders was delayed by over a week after I paid for fast shipping. When I emailed customer service, they simply told me that my order would be delayed further and to email back if I had any other problems. THATS ALL THEY TOLD ME. No help or an attempt to give a credit or expedite the shipping. I can promise you I won’t be shopping at ASOS any longer and that’s coming from someone who’s spend over $1000 from them in just a few months.

            Ive ordered 4 things, 3 pieces a jewelery and an expensive dress. The jewelry arrived on time - even though no tracking number was provided for me and my order status hasnt changed from “we’ve got it” so i couldnt even check on it. But surprise surprise the dress is nowhere to be find. The only thing which keeps me from exploding is that the dress wasnt even listed in the delivery - so it should arrive separately. Ok. But when? Why doesnt anyone from ASOS email me about this? I paid for it, i ordered it, where is my dress?! But the best thing is that i contacted them via email through the site, no answer. Via live chat -> ok they going to look at it, nothing happened. And another email, no answer. This is a joke. They have my money, i dont have my dress. Never going to order again.

            I'm so bummed. I've been the biggest fan of ASOS for absolute ages (like actually fan-girling to friends about how great they are). Always loved their quick returns and the clothes (lived in the UK). This was my first time ordering clothes in Sweden and two days after I got the email for despatch I got an email saying the order had been returned and refunded, without ever seeing the parcel. Contacted customer service which was honestly just not helpful and came off as rude. The agent ended up closing the chat on me without giving me any answers to why this happened or even saying he would try and find out. Barely got an apology either. Worked in customer service myself and the way they have handled this mistake is beyond bad. So so so disappointed in the company and will be looking for other online stores from now on.. wouldn't recommend them to anyone again.

            No more free returns for some countries! No clear statment that returns are no longer free; Asos should clearly state that returns are not free, especially if returns were free before Asos changed returns policy! 8 EUR for return from Lithuania, which is 27% from 30 EUR basket, is outrageous.

            I've now had several great experiences with this company, I've never ever experienced delays in my orders, nor have I experienced missing items. If anything I've experienced quite the opposite, a couple of times my order has even arrived earlier than expected. Just finished talking to customer service, unfortunately I made a mistake in returning my order, but even though it was my own mistake, the ASOS team didn't hesitate to go out of their way to create a whole new return note for me, and guide me through what I had to do step for step. Easy to say that I am beyond impressed time and time again by this company.I am very thoroughly pleased and happy about the experiences I've had with this trustworthy company. I can only wholeheartedly recommend this company to anyone who is in need of, great, cheap, durable clothes delivered quickly at your own home, with easy returns, and full refunds.

            I paid £5.95 for next day delivery and my order total was £99.95. They were all holiday bits that I needed, bikinis etc., and the customer service is APPALLING. The parcel never arrived the next day, nor the day after, and I’m currently 5 days in and it has still not arrived. I’ve messaged them on Twitter, live chatted to them and emailed them multiple times, and nobody is helping. I haven’t had an apology, nor is anybody bothered. Today I got an email to say that some of my items had gone out of stock, most likely due to processing them 5 days later than when I ordered. There is still no sign of my parcel and they’re not interested at all, they’ve closed my case and aren’t investigating it further. Which means I paid £5.95 to receive my order at the same rate that I could have had it for free, if not worse. They said this isnt unusual and that I was just unlucky. I’ve never had customer service this bad in my life - NEVER SHOP HERE.

            Frankly, Asos was my favorite website to shop in, their selection, quality and delivery were on point, but now I am totally loosing my opinion. The deliveries are often late although I have premier delivery and also they are sending the wrong ordered items, I am totally upset I couldn't get my orders on the specified time for my birthday vacation. Biggest disappointment ever and also the customer help live chat are very rude and never give you a solution to the problem, instead they just hover around the question only. The 2 stars rating I am giving is just for my previous experience. Now, I am totally hating it. I used to recommend this website a lot, and now I totally regret it. The standards are going low.

            My order number is 423936630 and 10 days have passed since I order. I have contacted them on a daily basis and they simple have kept me waiting. The courier have lost my order and the only thing now is ASOS to claim and replace or refund but they just keep me waiting days and days for nothing. Even more, they already close the chat when I ask why they do not replace. They do not even have a phone number or bother with their customer, its just MAD!Last enquire was requesting head office contact details to see if someone can really look in to this and sort it, but as soon as I request they ended the chat.DO NOT ADVISE!

            I will not order from this site ever again. I was suppose to have my dress to attend a wedding. I paid extra to have my dress arrive three days early just to find out it will not arrive on time.

            I would leave a zero if possible.Hermes attempted delivery,  left a card with no date or contact details. When I tracked order it said delayed.  Allegedly they attempted twice more, no card was left. I contacted ASOS to be told the parcel was being returned and to contact them if nothing heard within 7 working days,  meanwhile I could reorder .7 working days has now passed,  ASOS want me to wait another week and refuse to refund. Meanwhile they keep telling me delivery was attempted 3 times and I can reorder. They are admitting I don't have the goods,  but are now extending their 7 working day deadline to 12 working days, before they will consider a refund. Patronising staff refuse to address the questions and keep sending same email. Despite being legally obliged to supply the goods or refund the money they insist on doing neither. If you want your money stolen order away!

            I love Asos and their clothes. The bad thing is their return policy with 28 days which is an odd and uneven number so it's hard to know the exact last day you have to return your clothes if you want your money back. There is no information on their website about it, other websites for example Zalando write which day you have to send back your order if you want your money back, but Asos doesn't have that service. I had to contact their customer service about this but it took weeks for them to reply, which is not ok! I eventually did send back clothes from the same order before the last return-date, but then recieved an email where Asos said that I returned the clothes too late - even though it was their customer service that told me that exact date! A bit confusing and strange, but they wrote in the email that they made an exception and will return my money this time. But this doesn't feel so safe for me as a customer.Also you have to print out your return labels. Seems a bit old, who owns a printer nowadays? I had to print out the labels from an internet shop for €7, there goes the free return. I also spent hours looking for a place with printers. I really love the clothes <3 but Asos need to update their return policy and become more modern.

            Will never order from ASOS again, they work with Yodel which is the worst delivery company on earth. I’m not sure what the problem is, but Yodel has a system saying that they had missed you, when they haven’t even attempt a delivery (no card left, no knocking on the door). I’ve had “missing” parcels that completely disappear, something very fishy with them. Why should I waist my time searching for my parcel I’ve paid for? ASOS has a responsibility to make sure that parcel gets to me, if they choose to work with the worst delivery company (probably coz they’re cheap) then I’ll choose not to buy from them.

            I did some shopping on the Asos website for several years and was always pleased with the service and delivery. In 2019, the store had some changes in the quality of service and especially in the delivery method. Several times in a row I received completely different goods instead of those ordered and had to send them back. One order came back to the store without specifying any reasons. I am a member of a group of buyers in the Asos store, which exists on Facebook and read similar complaints every day. Why is the store management not taking action? Many have stopped shopping at this store.

            If you use a discount code and have return an item from the order, you can ask for a replacement. However, if the replacement isn’t available at the time, they do nothing - so you lose the discount off the rest of the order. Then they make absolutely no effort to rectify this, effectively duping you into spending money that you wouldn’t have, if it wasn’t for the offer. Then you ask them for an alternative replacement and they refuse. And then, when you ask them to cancel your account, they refuse to (breaching data protection regulations) unless you opt out of marketing that you had no idea that you opted into in the first place. Dreadful customer service all round.

            I used the live chat to check why they were not dispatching my order. The woman told me my order was processing and I would be told when it left their warehouse. She then went on to say I had to wait till the end of the day to see if my order arrived and she wouldn’t look into it any further. I said well my order clearly isn’t going to arrive today if it hasn’t even been dispatched yet. She then said sorry I can’t help you any further and SHE ended the live chat. Absolutely appalling customer service. It should be the customer that ends a live chat! Maybe it has something to do with the timer they have on the top of their live chats. They clearly have a limit on how long they’re prepared to deal with you! There was no reason why she couldn’t look into why my order was delayed, she just wouldn’t go against policy of making me wait till after the estimated arrival date. So now I’m completely lost as to where my order is and I have to waste more of my time tomorrow.

            Looks like I am not the only one who was scammed by ASOS! I placed an order for 6 dressed and used a promotion code. I kept all but one dress which did not fit. After about two weeks, I reached out to the company to understand what the status was on my return and they informed me that because I used a promo code I needed to meet a $250 spending minimum in order to receive a refund. Because my order did not reach this minimum they refused to refund, credit or even return the dress to me. I have askedseveral times for them to return the dress, to which they have told me they cannot do and I would need to repurchaseonline. They refuse to let me speak with a manager, lack any empathy and have no phone number to call. The online chat support even disconnected our chat. Will never buy from them again!

            I received an incorrect item from asos and when I contacted customer services, they said that that I should return the item at my own cost and they would refund me afterwords. When I tried to do so, my paypal account did not work and in order for it to work, they needed some documents that I do not currently possess therefore it could take a while for my account to be fully activated. I informed asos about it and asked for a different way to pay for the return. Not only they were rude, as in it was not their issue that my paypal account did not work, they were also not helpful at all. So now I have to keep stuff that I did not order, so I will probably donate them. I at least expected that they would care, since it was their fault (incorrect items) not mine. I used to be a fan of asos, I'll definitely not order from it never ever again.

After contacting them they said a ""Specialist"" would be in touch, otherwise contact them again if I do not hear anything. I did not hear anything so I contacted them again and got a response of ""We're busy at the moment so wait until they contact you"" I asked when that would be and they said they didn't know and then ended the chat.I then went to another chat and immediately a different adviser said to wait for the specialists and ended the chat once again. 2I am now down £430 and I still haven't heard from their so called ""Specialist"". ASOS used to be great, and I recommended them to everybody I knew as they were so easy to use. However for the past year, they have made lots of mistakes and their Customer Services are shocking. They are rude and just use generic robotic responses (they could quite well be robots). They don't keep you updated when you have a query they just leave you wondering what is happening whilst you do not have your money or your items.I am still astonished how you managed to pack 3 items out of the 14 within the order and send it without including any paperwork or anything else. How did you go so wrong? Unfortunately I will never be using ASOS again once this gets resolved (if it ever does).

            We waited over a month for the first delivery, which ended up being lost in the 'local post'. ASOS fashion- could not track this delivery. We tried again and lost our second order in the post. Two months later now, they have no idea where our order is, we still have nothing and still were asked by customer support to wait another 14 days for the order to arrive. The wait continues...

            Hi ASOS,  On Monday July 15th I made an order of 5469,80 kr. on the app, this includes ""Premier Delivery"". Later that day I received an email that my order would be delayed, so in stead of being delivered on Tuesday 16th it would be delved on Wednesday 18th. I could live with that. Unfortunately, it still hasn’t been delivered, and today is the 21th of July! Which means it is belayed 6 days. I've been in contact with your costumer service by mail the past 6 days, but unfortunately it hasn't helped much. It seems that you still haven't sent my order, hence the costumer service mostly send me a standard reply of me receiving an email when the order has been sent. At the same time, you ask me to check with my neighbours and post office to see if the order has been delivered there which makes no sense since you later in the mail tell me that the parcel hasn't been packed yet. I haven't got a confirmation nor, nor a tracking number but the money has been withdrawn from my account on the 17th of July!  I think this is outrageous and I would like to get in contact with somebody that doesn't just send me a standard reply. And I really, really think that a compensation is in it's right place for this very, very bad experience. I don't is is ok to treat your costumers this badly. If needed I can provide you a screen shot of all the mail correspondence.  And yes I’ve been to the post office and asked my neighbours which is extremely embarrassing that I have to spend MY time on a service I have payed for.

            Horrible, untrustworthy, scandalous business. I ordered a maternity dress for my brothers wedding and it showed up 6 weeks past it’s time of delivery. I sent it back as it was too late for the wedding and it’s been 7 weeks since I sent it back to them and still no refund. I’ve asked to speak with a manager or someone who can provide me non scripted answers and I get nothing. I have no idea how this is a legit online store. Anyone associated with ASOS should be ashamed. I would never recommend them and plan on reporting this to the better business burrows.

            Absolutely appalling customer service. Ordered an item and it was late to deliver. Logged into their partners and it said that there should be an information slip for the delivery instructions and they have tried to deliver 3 times but none was in and they are taking it back to the warehouse. I have received no delivery attempts, information slips or anything else. I contacted customer service and they said there is nothing they can do and I have to wait 7+10days (for the order to get back to warehouse and for the refund to be processed). I told them I just want the product and surely they can just reorder as it is not my fault that the delivery company did not leave any information slip for me to rearrange,but in the end I am the only person,who is paying the price so to speak, and they said that they can only go by the information from the delivery provider and cannot do anything more. I asked to log a complaint and the guy said that they do not have a complaint logging system, which is even crazier. Goes on to show how much they care about their customers' constructive criticism and experiences.

            I ordered Shoes, on a Thursday and paid €12.99 extra for next day delivery, hence the Friday, as I wanted the shoes for an event on the Sunday. Needless to say the, Shoes DID NOT arrive on the Friday. Delivery date, according to DHL would be sometime before 6pm on the Monday. We do NOT have a postal Service on a Saturday in Ireland. So I've paid extra for a Service I have NOT received. I am demanding the reimbursement of the €12.99. Lesson learned for Irish Customers..

            I ordered a pair of ASOS shorts in size 34” and a multipack of socks. The shorts I needed urgently before a holiday so opted for £6 one day delivery, I would not have bought the socks had I not been buying the shorts. They arrived and were outrageously large on me, having measured the waist they were 37” and labelled as 34”. Although the shorts can be refunded I didn’t think unfair to also ask for the delivery to be refunded as to me this is a faulty item, the customer service representatives disagreed and refuse to do anything. It is also wrong that they do not have a review system in place so that people can be warned of this earlier. To me this is completely unfair and shouldn’t be done by large companies exploiting high delivery costs to make a profit.

            I've had a dreadful experience with asos over the past couple of weeks. After expecting my order to arrive 1 week after placing the order, I was advised it would not be arriving for at least another 10 days. When tracking the order today, I then see that Hermes claimed to have attempted 3 deliveries and we're now sending my order back. This was untrue and no attempted delivery cards have been left. I took my complaint to asos ""chat now"" and was told by Paige that there was nothing they could do and I'd receive a refund in 7 days. No apology and no sympathy. Terrible customer service.

            Ordered multiple large orders from their site over time, no issues. My last order more than half my items were missing. I paid the duties based on the complete order. They sent me my missing items refunding a small amount considering the size and dollars spent leaving me to pay duties and express cost of the shipment again. A little customer service would be nice, reimbursing some of my $ by refunding another item would have been nice...no such luck! Their mistake left me paying even more..very simple complaint and issue but how it was handled lost them a customer along with the people I have suggested use their site and purchased.

            Asos offers free returns so of course I found that helpful when shopping on their site for the first time for a jumpsuit. I ordered several different designs in several sizes since I didn’t know what my size would be in their clothing. Their business model seemed to be online only sales woth no brick and mortar so it made sense to me that they’d offer free returns. It was a large order and ultimately nothing fit except for ONE. I was hoping to keep 2-3 designs to have for different occasions. I made a second order to try different styles. They also didn’t fit and because they were sale items, the stock was low and I couldn’t order different sizes. So I decided to return both orders (value $400) and kept the one jumpsuit. I prepared them to mail using the labels that ASOS sent with the order. And I dropped them in the UPS secured pickup box in my building. One made it and was processed a few days later. The second and bigger one still isn’t made it and I’ve reached out several times by chat and email to Asos about this. They’re telling me they haven’t received it yet and need proof of postage. Well because I used the labels they sent, I don’t have proof of postage. It’s over $300 that I’ve lost and I’m real mad. I can’t believe they don’t have a call center because chat and email don’t suffice to problem solve- that must be done in person. Instead they just send me their canned responses. They also wouldn’t transfer me to a supervisor. I’ve NEVER had problems with other retailers like this- amazon, Wayfair, Pact, Gap, etc- they don’t ask for proof of postage and my returns have always been refunded. As well, the “proof of postage” language is not on the materials in the packaging that Asos includes so I followed the rules and now they’re telling me I’m wrong. They have “policies” that I have to follow but apparently my own policies don’t matter. I’ve asked them for proof they haven't received it but they disregard that. It’s crap. Plus the clothing is low quality so don’t even bother.

            Made an order on wednesday for next day delivery, DPD updated tracking to say they have recieved the order details but not the parcel. Contacted them yesterday, told me to wait 24 hours. This morning came and I contacted them again, someone passed it through to a different department to be ""investigated"". When i checked the tracking again, it said they had requested it to be sent back to them. AND THEN the parcel had been recieved by my local depot! I phoned both DPD and ASOS who both told me nothing could be done. Dpd said that asos had to cancel the request and it could then be delivered to us today. After one phone call, a few emails and a online chat, I was told that they ""cant do anything"" and to wait 7 days for a refund before ordering again.. which is a complete joke, what happened to the investiagtion that was suppose to happen to see if it was being delivered?

            Worst customer service.Ordered shoes for an event with next day delivery, the DPD delivery driver called Marlon didn't bother coming at my door while I was in waiting patiently for the scheduled delivery, next thing I received an email confirming that the parcel was delivered and signed by someone else whereas no first attempt was made and I repeat I was in. Upon calling customer services and complaining about the fact that I needed it resolved ASAP because I was going to a work event and the shoes where in that parcel, an agent called Gilly with the worst attitude told me that they won't do anything about it and that it was okay according to terms and conditions if the driver doesn't deliver to the customer but make the decision to leave the parcel in what he believes is a ""safe place"". What is the point to take people's address and stop drop the parcel elsewhere!!! Basically, they support lazinessof the driver but we pay for next day delivery then we have to locate the parcel ourselves while they are happy to charge you without fulfilling the deal. Absolutely disgusting way of treating the customer. On top of that, she was very condescending, dismissive and literally paused the conversation then asked me what was my question again? Nobody is willing to help and instead they repeat the same thing and end the conversation with """"we can't do anything about it, anything else I can help you with?"" If this is trained customer care, this is a joke. No solution was issued and I had to cancel a prepaid event attendance. WELL DONE ASOS. WHAT A GOOD JOB!!!!!

            Had a terrible experience with ASOS customer service over the past two weeks.They shipped my order through YODEL, an equally incompetent company (look at their Trustpilot site to see how bad they are at doing their job of delivering parcels!).Yodel claimed to have attempted delivery 4 times (while I was at home), to then claim they lost my parcel. Asos decided to send me a replacement order (but couldn't confirm they would ship with a different courier... great.), however the most important item I had bought was now out of stock.I tried time and time again to speak to a human at customer services, but kept getting the same robotic email responses, with nobody clearly reading my query or bothering to answer the actual question I had. Several of the email ""responses"" I received from their ""customer service"" people were not at all related to my question. Do not use ASOS unless you want your parcels stolen by Yodel drivers and then to deal with an endless amount of basically talking to a wall when trying to contact ASOS customer service :)

            What’s happened ASOS!I use to shop with no problems! But now had two issues in a row and customer care were useless. First the item was missing, then the replacement they sent was completely the wrong item. Now I have to wait to return it and they advised they would send me the correct item if it’s in stock, or I could have a refund! I just want the correct item in the expected time frame. In summary, I’m out of pocket and I don’t have the item. Not impressed!

            I had so much trouble with my order... After their website clearly had a bug (tested after), it was delivered to my old address, despite me changing it a few times while selecting a delivery option. After contacting customer services, they couldn't help and were copying and pasting the same information I could find on the website, and not even answering my questions.. I felt like talking to a wall..After that, I had to return two of the garments from the order, and it has been 7 working days haven't heard about the refund and every time contacting customer services, they tell me to wait and give until the end of the day. Also, it takes 40 minutes to get a reply to 3 questions on the live chat. One of the worst customer services ever.

            I ordered some clothing for a month long vacation I am going on in a week, and I ordered it with expedited 2 day shipping just to be sure it will get here in time. On the day it was supposed to arrive i checked the tracking number and it said the package was being held by Fedex. So I called fedex and they said the package was found to be empty and they will not deliver the empty package to me and that I need to contact ASOS. So I contacted ASOS customer support and they said that they will investigate for the next 10 days, then they will make a decision. I explained to them that I ordered with expedited 2 day shipping and I need a fund because I will be leaving the country this week and will not be here nor will I need the clothing once I am gone. They will not give me a refund even though I will not receive my package. So now I am stuck with no clothes and no money. I have to pay my credit card off and they refuse to refund me for the missing or stolen package, even though fedex officially confirms the package  is empty. Asos refuses to refund me! Horrible customer care, they straight out rob you of your money and don’t get you your clothing.

            I ordered five pairs of shoes from them, and they sent the shoes to the wrong address. When my shoes went missing I contacted them regarding my order and they said they would send me a replacement. A day later someone showed up from two houses down my block saying they had some packages that they thought belonged to me. So I contacted ASOS saying that the original order was found. Then they said that I had to return my original order and that there would be a new order to replace every shoe. Unfortunately the new order only consisted of one pair as the other shoes were out of stock(which was not mentioned by any of the five agents I talked to). So now I have to return almost everything I bought, when I could just keep my order and send the new shoe that came back to them. I would rank them lower than one star but it would not let me.

I get contacted by support and they indicate that there was a problem with my order and that they had refunded the money because the ring was not shipped. I write back, (I’ve been a customer for several years with a history of much more expensive orders) indicating that I did receive the ring and that I authorize them to debit me again. Result? A customer representative writes to me indicating I have to send the ring back!!!!! I write back indicating that I’m not willing to do that for several reasons (time, principles, and no reason to pay for their mistake) and that I will be awaiting for indications to pay and today I get the next customer representative indicating that, despite the reasons I have indicated, I need to send the ring back. I have now answered that the ring is no longer in my hands and to indicate how to pay. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE it used to be a good service now it is not anymore.

            Just had a horrific experience with Asos. The first time in over 10 year of shopping have I had such a negative experience. I am going on holiday and proceeded to purchase next day delivery for my order 423770233. The parcel did not arrive in time and I contacted the asking why it was late and I was met with a haughty matter of fact attitude. I am completely shocked at the customer service from Elaine who completely was unsympathetic towards my situation knowing I’m flying today without essential last minute items for my holiday. I had to insist the refund my delivery fee it wasn’t even suggested which I couldn’t believe considering the fact they did not fufil the order and they have now left my parcel with someone whom I have never met and telling me to locate it as they’ve no idea where it is??? I’m honestly shocked SHOCKED and furthermore disappointed but this company.

            I've been using Asos for years, since they first started in the UK. I've always loved their clothes and customer service, until the last couple of years. I always order large orders of £100-£300 because I've been losing weight and don't always know what size I am. Normally I try everything on and send back what doesn't fit or suit me. Lately Asos haven't been fully processing my large orders, leaving me with massive bills and then I have to call and email back and forth for days, sometimes weeks to explain that the whole order was in one bag and why hasn't my whole refund been processed. I have now filed an official complaint after being asked to pay £115, when I should in fact be paying £42. This happens only on large orders, where there is more than one Returns form. This has also started happening to friends of mine who also use Asos. After being a loyal customer for 18 years, I've asked them how to shut down my account. It's just not worth the hassle. You get no apology, no compensation and it's time consuming.

            I deeply regret ever buying from asos because this website is absolute rubbish. The amount of headaches buying from them has given me is crazy but now i’ve finally learned my lesson and i will never buy from them again. And i do not recommend anyone to go to buy from their rubbish shop. I’ve seen many bad reviews lately and i can completely understand, because their service is absolute rubbish, their customerservice doesn’t do anything and they will take your money in a second, but when it comes to refunds and damage compensation they will take forever or they won’t even get back to it at all. This has been going on for too long now and i’ve tried many times to reach out to customer service with regards to next day delivery, i ordered two times and both times it wasn’t delivered the next day and it took a couple of days which is bad service, you don’t even get what you pay for. So for anyone reading, don’t even bother paying for next day delivery cause you won’t even get it the next day and they’ll say they can’t do anything for you. And when you speak to one of the workers they always give you the same, arrogant, generic answers. It’s been over a month that I returned things i bought from asos and i still haven’t received a refund, not even an email or anything. I want my damn money back and a compensation for all the headache and wasted time and wasted effort with horrible customer service they gave me.

            I wish I could give zero stars - it would be more appropriate for the abysmal customer service and delivery from this company. I placed three orders in three days, one arrived early but the other two are missing. Each time I speak to Asos, they ask me to wait another week, and then another week; constantly moving the goal posts to buy themselves more time. Their love chat agents are arrogant and rude, they cut off the chat when they cannot be bothered to answer more questions. Their twitter account churns our generic answers that have no relevance to your query. Those answering emails have poor reading comprehension and ignore the questions in your email only to be so unhelpful you almost wish they never even replied. I’m not sure when they started using Hermes but it was big mistake - although this awful incompetent delivery company has a lot in common with Asos lately. They won’t refund you for missing items, but debit your account within seconds. I’m taking it up with PayPal and I won’t stop messaging Asos until I have my money back.

The item was shipped 4 days after the order was placed. In that time, since it was a very important order (otherwise I wouldn't have paid extra for a such specific delivery), I contacted Customer Services via email, chat, Messenger and IG:- IG messages: these were deleted by Asos without giving an answer and there were very polite messages (I would never think of swearing, insulting, etc. when writing CS since I have worked many years in the industry and I know how hard it can be at times). I have encountered other people that had had this in the past, but deep inside I thought that they had sworn or being rude, etc. But obviously, asking for help is not tolerated that well.- Messenger: noone read my message until 6 days after my order was placed (and finally received). Their notes say that they reply to you within 24h. Busier times? Increase the team; I am sure that a billion-pound business can afford to have a large enough customer service force?- chat: I was disconnected 3 times and the time someone didn't cut me off and really try to help they said that they were not prepared to deal with queries that they just know about what is in stock.- email: no one replied to me until the day my parcel was shipped and they blamed the courier saying that they could not control if the courier was not delivering the item (wrong, to be honest, it is the responsibility of the sender to make sure the item arrives - but this is another thread). I know courier services are very unreliable most of the time, but blaming someone for something they are not responsible for it is simply bad practice and pretty unfair on the courier service.In the end, I received my parcel 5 days after order it, 4 days after the scheduled, paid, specific delivery. So I decided to return the items since they were no longer needed. Well, issues continue:- I requested a refund for the Next Day Evening Delivery and after several attempts, someone said they had issued the refund back to my Paypal, 2 weeks later I am still waiting and nothing has hit my account. - The parcel I sent back (thanks to having a tracking number from Royal Mail) was delivered exactly 48h after sending it out. No refund has been received and it has also been over 10 working days (which it the limit Asos asks you to wait for), 2 weeks in total. Noone knows anything.I hope I can solve this issue and I get both my refunds so I can finally close my account with Asos and stop using them altogether.You reach a point whereby you expect a service to be as good as what a retailer can offer you to sell; unfortunately, Asos has the worst Customer Service I have ever encountered both in my professional career and as a customer. Customer Service is not an easy job (I've been there), but the attitude of some advisors is appalling and Asos definitely doesn't seem to invest in training to have people ready and available to help customers on the spot. Customers spend their money and they deserve being treated properly and helped when needed. For Asos £100 order/refund might be nothing, but for customers, this is money (a lot, for some) they have probably worked very hard to get to spend £100 and having such bad experience is really daunting and unfair.I wouldn't say ""don't use them"", but if I was new I would make sure I checked people's experiences to understand if it's worth it in the long run. I am definitely not using them again.

            perfect products (that's because I order the best ones) and very good service. I use them for more than 5 years now and they've never failed my expectations. couple of times the untracked shipments were missing and once a wrong item was sent, but all was immediately refunded/replaced, including return postages. standard delivery handling takes now more time than it used to, but since I trust them 100%, I just wait and everything is always okay

            Ordered 2 packages on the same day. Never recieved a tracking number on any of the packages like I used to. NO packages has arrived from ASOS.I ordered my orders on the 22nd of June and the packages was expected on the 28th of June. On that date I contacted them and they asked me to wait until the 4th of July for the packages to arrive. They didn't arrive there either. I contacted them again on the 5th of July and said that I would like a full refund. They sent my request to the specialist team and said that they would get back to me by email.I have not heard ANYTHING from them and every time I ask them what is going on they are saying: The specialist team will get back to you as soon as possible.I will never order from them again - that is for sure!I will change my review if they will ever refund me my $300!

            Awful. V. rare that the next-day delivery option works - when the parcel is inexplicably delayed you are told to wait a further 5 days, before it's investigated. The agreement with Hermes does not allow ASOS to contact them, so all the Customer Services team can do is read the same tracking information that you have access to. Will not refund delivery charge or reissue orders that go missing. Separately we've received items that have clearly been used or left screwed up in a corner (had to return an expensive blazer because even ironing couldn't save it from the state it turned up). Also, issues where the delivery has gone wrong at the ASOS warehouse (hasn't even made it to Hermes!) and they've still refused to investigate / claimed they can't contact the warehouse and have made out like it's nothing to do with them...In short: wherever possible AVOID

            Awful Awful Customer Service. They’d sent a tagless, clearly worn dress, which I’m after as it’s the right fit/colour etc (it went out of stock when I bought it- must’ve been the last one, so an exchange was not an option unfortunately- but said I was happy to exchange it if she knew of any UNWORN ones floating about)Explained all this and said that I’m also happy to keep it if they could give me a discount- didn’t acknowledge anything I’d written other than it was tagless - she said sorry it was tagless and to use the delivery note to return it. No s£@t Sherlock. It makes no difference clearly to this company if you’ve been a regular good  customer- Maddison her name was, didn’t have the courtesy to even bother telling me whether it’s policy or not to offer discount on faulty/used items. She cut off the chat before I even got a chance to ask.

Now, MY mistake was that I decided to let ASOS know of the mistake THEY had made..And then I chatted with Jerome..Jerome, almost like a nice little robot, simply quoted policy to me and insisted that I should return the item for a refund. After stating, multiple times, that i simply contacted them to inform them of this, when i simply could have let this go, I was told that if I didn't proceed with the return I might have ""problems"" in future returns!!!!For real ASOS!?!

            Absolutely worst experience I have had shopping from a “well known” brand. Do not order internationally. I ordered product to Canada to arrive on or before July 8, and still have not received my product. They did not provide tracking for my order - which is shocking in our day and age of tracking product internationally. I was first advised it was a technical delay, then a technical glitches, then told to wait longer for no reason. They did not answer my questions and kept saying to wait until August 3 (an arbitrary date?) to receive my package although I am meant to receive it NO LATER then July 8. This is legitimately a scam and now I am out $300. I will be reporting this.

            This review is a warning to all ASOS customers.I have ordered from ASOS for many years, but lately it has turned upside down into the worst experience ever.1) ASOS did not deliver my order.2) ASOS did not warn me about any delivery delays.3) ASOS lied and provided me false tracking number claiming that they have dispatched the order (the tracking No. provided no results).4) ASOS informed me about a one-day-delay in the delivery.5) ASOS finally informed me that my order is cancelled and that I will receive a refund in 5-10 days (after checking my account I see that the order has NOT been cancelled).I placed my order on 28th of June. I haven't had the chance to actually speak to a human being.

            Customer service is the worst.I made a purchase that should have been delivered within 5 business days, for which I was charged immediately. When the order didn't arrive, customer service would not give me any answers and just told me to wait.Twelve days after my purchase I was informed that the items I ordered were not in stock (though they available were when I ordered them) so I would get a refund within the next 10 working days.

Is no one checking what’s being sent out?- Use of terrible couriers, so despite paying for the annual next day delivery it’s not guaranteed - Foundation being received with no hygiene seal...OR LID!By far the worst thing is their returns process. I tend to put all my items into one package and somehow I only get refunded for ONE ITEM. It then takes weeks/months of chasing to get the rest of your money. Clearly ASOS weren’t prepared for the growth they’ve had. A company of their size should have clear, defined processes that work. They should have proper customer service with people you can actually talk to over the phone, why is social media the only way of contacting them. They care about the reputation on social media but they don’t actually care about the customers who give them their hard earned money. Sort it out!

            Just awful. Wish I could give 0 stars. I bought a dress on June 13th to wear for my engagement party on August 4th. The dress was to supposed to arrive July 9th and it is no where to be seen. The tracking information has not updated since it left the warehouse. I contacted them numerous times and each time they tell me I have to wait until a different date before they can do anything - July 29th, July 31st, August 2nd, August 6th. I explained my party is on August 4th and I need my dress but they don't care. I asked them to send a replacement dress and they refused to do anything because they ""have to follow certain processes"". It's absolutely absurd. I will now have to look for a new dress elsewhere with almost no time left thanks to ASOS. Never ever purchasing from them again. I just wish I'd read the reviews before making my purchase.

            Simply awful service.I have to give one star, but I wouldn't even want to give them one star.I have complained about my missing package and I cant get a straight answer from the company. First I was told to wait until after the 4th of July, when I then contact them again on the 5th of July, I'm being told to wait until after the 9th of July. Then i follow up on the 10th and I'm told to wait until the 16th, because all the multiple other advisers I spoke to before (which are at this point 5 plus advisers) have all given me incorrect information. I have requested a refund multiple times but I am told their hands are tied until after the 4th, after the 9th and now after the 16th. I have STILL not received my refund and they are refusing to act until after the 16th were I expect I will be told to wait until after probably the 20th or something. This is a total scam!Not only are they not able to advise me, most of the advisers I spoke to were rude and passive aggressive. The reason I have had to go through so many advisers is that they keep closing the chat on me and changing adviser.I would advise everyone not to use ASOS. I am myself prepared to launch an official complaint.

            I am normally a very patient person but my first experience of Asos may well be my last!  I was attempting to place an order using outlet25 which would have given me 25% off my order.  The checkout would not accept applepay, any of my cards and wouldn't accept pay pal. This was 11pm.  I gave up trying at 1am and tried again in the morning and got fed up so went live chat and contacted customer services, this went on back and forth for a few days.  Obviously the code expired and Asos won't honour the code even though it was no fault of my own and hey I was only trying to give them an order!!!!!!!!!!    This is poor Asos , you definately don't appreciate customers trying to give you business.

            I placed an order worth EUR 300 on June 30. Estimated delivery July 5. Today, on July 11, the products have not yet even been sent. They now estimate the delivery somewhere between July 18-25. However, they refuse to change shipping address despite the fact that I ordered the products to our summer house, but will end my vacation and go home after July 16.It's a disaster, because I won't get my products and also because I won't get my money back until 4-6 weeks after the delivery (the package stays 2 weeks at the post office, then adding 2-4 weeks repayment time). Which is nearly two months from now. The products are sold out so I can't re-order them. Also, worst customer service ever.

            Terrible customer service and rip off delivery. I made an order on Friday for next day delivery which cost me £5.99. Item not delivered until Monday. I made a complaint due to next day delivery not being met even though I had paid extra for this. ASOS said they cant guarantee it and never refunded me. Basically told me tough luck. Other companies have always refunded me if they dould not meet the next day delivery time. ASOS you have lost a customer through your rip off fees and bad attitude to your customers

            Seems I'm not the only one furious with ASOS customer service. I love them as a place to buy from and have always paid £9 a year for next day delivery. BUT this time they have let me down and their customer service was disgusting. I purchased an item and received something completely wrong. When sending photo proof and asking for the correct item to be sent they told me they can no longer do this, but I'm more than welcome to return for a refund and re order in the mean time. This has put me out of pocket as refunds take up to 14 working days and I do not have the item I ordered. I've also had the inconvenience of having to go to the post office to return the item when I shouldn't have had to do this if the correct thing had been delivered. Customer service was completely useless, told me they couldn't help, but instead encouraged me to use their credit company Klarna to order as I wouldn't have to pay back for up to 45 days. Not only was this unhelpful but also incredible worrying that this is something they're pushing for people to do! Overall I feel completely let down, and am in two minds about ordering again as I feel it isn't something I should have to do

            Worst experience ever! My last order never shipped and customer service wasn't helpful at all as they've only keep on repeating some robotic answers on my complaints about it. I'm still waiting and don't know the right reason why my order is still in their warehouse. Also, customer service was very rude, quitting chats without reason just because they don't have the right answer. Don't know what's wrong but something is really strange there! Guess I'll have to take some legal steps to resolve this situation.UPDATE: They've contacted me yesterday and told me that my order was cancelled due to issues with their warehouse in Germany and that I have been refunded money back to my credit card (but I have to wait 5-10 working days for money to appear on my account).I forgot to mention what have happened to me that day when I've placed my order from Asos. First I've tried to pay via PayPal (which I've done a couple of times before with no problems) but the checkout process wasn't successful and the page told me something like ""something went wrong, please check items in your bag"" and I've checked them, everything was there, so I've tried to pay again via PayPal but the same thing happened again. In that moment I've realised that something is really wrong and then I saw two e-mails from PayPal with same orders, but strangely - one calculated in euros and another one in pounds. After that I contacted Asos Customer Care via chat and told them what happened and they've told me that they are very sorry but they can't give me my money back right away and that I have to wait 5-10 working days to get my money back. Also, they've admitted that this was their fault as something went wrong on their page and that was the reason that I couldn't pay with PayPal. I've told them that I really want to buy those items and kindly ask them can they reserve those items for me and their answer was - NO. After that I ask them to give me money back right away and the answer was - NO. After that I've told them to handle my order manually as I paid for it twice and they've told me - NO. They really weren't interested to solve my problem and I've spoke to many members of Customer Care that day as they were quitting chats with me because I was trying to make them solve this problem. In the end, one person from Customer Care told me that the only way to buy those items was to pay for them with another payment method and because I really wanted those items I paid via credit card. After this debacle, my order never came and yesterday they've told me that they've refunded my money. So, I paid for my items and never get them. My balance on PayPal was the same that day when all of this happened so I didn't worry about it too much as in e-mails from PayPal was stated ""please note that this is not a charge, your account will be charged when the merchant processes your payment"", but yesterday I went to see something on my bank account and saw that this amount is still reserved, so I've contacted PayPal, also. So many troubles and so many hours lost just because one order from ASOS.

But the stupid thing happened this time I ordered , the order I made on 1st July, and they still haven’t shipped yet, and I contact with customer service, omg , their responses are unbelievable and ridiculous, they said you need to wait after 9th July then you can contact us again, but they haven’t shipped my items , and for me, if you haven’t shipped yet , then how can I receive it ? I am so tired of communicating with them, so I reported them on PayPal since I am glad that I paid with PayPal, then PayPal can investigate the case and give me the refund.

            I ordered from ASOS a fair number of times and it was ok. But the last time I ordered they sent me a completely wrong size so I asked them if they can send me a size that I ordered and someone in customer service said that they can't do that. That first I need to return the product I've got and than within 45 working days (which practically is freaking 9 weeks or maybe more) they will repay me and I can order again what I want.

            Worst ever.Ordered on 29th May - today 9th July I still haven't received either my order or one single email explaining anything else than I'll receive my order on 7th June or before!I've been writing their customer service (poor guys) - they respond with their standard replies and message has been so far that they can't help and 'please write back to tomorrow then we'll make sure you get your money back'. Latest the reply has been that a specialist team member will look into the case and contact me - they've said that 6 times over the last 3 weeks. I've heard absolutely nothing. I just want my money back for something I never received.DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS. They used to have a fair service and live up to their delivery but this is the worst - that they haven't delivered, nor informed me, nor refunded me and I placed the order in MAY..

I've placed 44 orders and have only ever encountered one issue, the 44th order!Sadly my experience with customer service on order number 44 was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I never received the order, and after chasing for 10 days, they now have said I can't get a re-deliery or refund. Worst customer service I have ever experienced, I've had to report the issue to my bank as ASOS are that bad. Yes, I'll still likely order again but at my own risk as the clothes range is too good. My word, I have never ever experienced such poor customer service.No care. Template complaint messages. I have lost huge trust In them. Hopefully my bank can now resolve this.

            Like others here - paid for next day delivery but the item I ordered didn't arrive. You can only contact ASOS through the chat or email - there is no inbound number to call. So I have now sent three messages to three different people about this, and have not had a satisfactory resolution. I have no idea when my item will arrive - it ""might arrive by the 11th"" is the best answer I get. Apparantly they have processed my refund for next day delivery fee, but this will take up to 2 weeks. You also can't contact their delivery company, Hermes. Apparently ASOS can't contact Hermes either, which I find very hard to believe. Overall, the standards have dropped with ASOS. Perhaps the delivery partner is new? Either way, really unimpressed and will not order from ASOS again after this experience.

            In my family we had two bad experience with ASOS , one I received the wrong model of a dress after many hassle to get refund another my daughter ordered two items with express delivery and haven't received when she talked to them they told to wait 5 more days it's unbelievable , so when you ordered something with express there is a reason that you want it for specific reason you don't need it afterwards you have to pay for other people mistakes .we asked for refund but no they said to wait , well ASOS is not reliable be careful when you buy something from them 2 bad experience from them

            Such an awful experience. Yashna the agent I spoke to on chat was not bothered at all, took ages to reply and couldn’t be bothered to check anything. I ordered next day delivery on the 5th, and was advised by email that it will arrive on the 11th. That’s not the next day! I’m leaving the country and tried to cancel but was basically told tough luck Asos are not bothered at allHermes delivery service is the worst I don’t know why they use them Seems from all these reviews a lot of people have had terrible experiences

            Poor choice of couriers and the CS team are unable to help or track deliveries - their help consists, most of the times, using the same line - ""wait until the end of the day to see if the delivery arrives"". Another issue today and Yashna, the agent that I spoke with via their chat was the agent, did not help in any way possible. Not even a quick call to track the delivery or check with the driver if he had the correct parcel or address details. I've paid the annual next day delivery pass, but that clearly means nothing to ASOS - must be just a fee to make extra money, as from my experience they are not able to keep their word as a service, shameless!Today I changed my plans to wait for the courier (obviously), as I had a specific slot for my delivery. During that time period, I get an email from DPS saying that they could not deliver as there was no one home - when in fact I was... and the most frustrating thing was that they posted a picture of the wrong house, when notifying me via email.Still waiting to see what they (ASOS and DPS) can do for me.Good app with good clothing options but terrible CS team and service in general.

            Here’s the crack with ASOS. 1. If you place an order, pay for it and are happy with it then ASOS has the widest choice and a good range of discounts of any retailer. 2. If on the other hand you have any issues. You’ll need to speak to customer services. You might as well forget. And speak to your card provider to raise a chargeback or Section 75 because it will save you a lot of hassle.

I contacted Asos and explained but there was nothing they can do due to their new company policy. All I could do is return and re order. When I went to re order, they didnt have my sizes :@ I've had to keep chasing contacting Asos for weeks as they claiming they hadn't received my return even though i sent it via the 48 hour Royal Mail label provided with the returns label that came with the order. A supervisor or manager is never available and people from the esculated team are supposed to call you BUT DONT. Nearly a month later they are apparently refunding me but stating they cannot manually refund to PayPal which I paid with... so I need to give my card/credit card details to them.. I will not be doing this and will be contacting PayPal tomorrow as this sounds absolutely ridiculous and do not trust the company after my experience and very bad customer service throughout.

            On the basis of my own and some of my friends´ experiences I suggest that you do not count on the date on which your order will probably arrive because to be honest it will not.Do NOT spend extra money on a next-day-delivery, it will definetly not work and they just make more money of it.

            I used to always shop with Asos as delivery was always fast and returning anything was always easy and stress-free however with my last few purchases I have had to return things and after not receiving any emails confirming my return a week after I had done so I used the live chat that they have on the website and it was there that I was informed of what was happening with my return and the man I was chatting to was helpful when it came to answering my questions about why I hadn’t been sent an email. His response was “you will have been sent an email, check your spam folder” which obviously I had done before getting in contact with them and so when I told him this he terminated the chat window so their customer service team do not deliver the best customer service and I know what good customer service is as I also work in retail so I think it was very poor that this has happened not once but twice to me.

            I've been shopping with asos since it first came about. However, in the past few years it's become pretty rubbish - I've had items arrive broken, late, sometimes completely the wrong item... in one instance, not at all (this was rectified). Their own brand products seem to be getting worse in quality. I used to really enjoy asos so I hope they turn this around, and I won't be shopping with them until then.

I've placed orders when things are in stock, 5 days later my items still arent dispatched then 3 days after that I am receiving refunds because my items are now out of stock and I've also had orders getting 'lost'. Not sure why its gone from items being dispatched within 5 hours and being delivered within 3 days and ALWAYS exceeding expectations to now taking the absolute mick.

Upon arrival i was charged $68 in duties and customs. When I opened the package I was sent wrong items. I order a two piece bikini, what they sent was two tops of different style. Needless to say I contacted them and they were like well send it back and refund you. So now that another $22.40 to send it back, so not only am I sending back the wrong top, I am also sending the correct top and the cover-up as I have ZERO need for the outfit as I had purchased it for the that weekend. The agents continued to disconnect my chats, they were passive and rude and promised to return the shipping fees. When I contacted them today to receive my shipping fee back they told me ""we cant do that"" I took a screenshot of the conversation I had with the agent who told me that i just needed to contact them after with the receipt and they would refund me and the guy I spoke with TASHAN didn't care that I was promised a refund. This is by far the worst service ever and they will never get another dollar from me EVER!

            Always have a brilliant experience with ASOS. Fast deliveries, easy to use website, a vast range of clothing of different prices and sizes, and very friendly customer service when asking for refunds for faulty clothing. Returns are also super easy so I never have to worry about things not fitting as I can send it straight back without any hassle!Also, a little thing to some but meaningful to me- i really love the diversity and honesty in your range of models. There's so much representation of different body types, skin colours, and abilities. I also LOVE that you don't airbrush and edit spots/scars/cellulite and other ""imperfections"". So refreshing to see normal natural bodies.

            Orders bridesmaids dresses that range from a size 6 to a size 18! Really impressed with being able to get all the sizes I needed and the quality of the dresses. I also had to return 2 dresses and the process was very easy and had my refund a few days later! Really impressed with the service! Defiantly will be using again.

            Their should be a 0 star, cause this company ASOS has the worst costumer service. They only sent you one copy of a return label and yet when you return an item they ask for a proof or a receipt. Theyre the one that printed the label for return and when you ask them to send you a copy their reply is "" I understand, however, we havent received your return and their is no tracking or receipt as proof of you returning this parcel. For this, Im unable to help you futher"". Then ended the chat. This customer sevice name BEN is rude..

            Everything is stellar except the customer service experience. No phone number to speak to a human and no tracking system for claims. my package arrived with $230+ items missing, and, nothing has been communicated to me regarding a resolution. I'm convinced their customer service reps are likely chat bots. It boggles the mind how a company the size of Amazon can get this so right, and ASOS (who ships their deliveries in plastic bags) seems to have no plan for this issue to which they're prone. I had the same thing happen a few years ago with a single item and the issue was resolved within the first communication. Not sure what has gone so spectacularly wrong with their Customer Service operations, but this long time customer and brand supporter will seriously consider shopping elsewhere in perpetuity.

            I did 3 recent orders with Asos and had no problems at all. I ordered through Klarna , which is perhaps why my refund was received quickly and transferred smoothly. The parcels did arrive on the due date ( standard delivery ), however I did do one next day delivery which I paid £5.95 for , but did not receive the next day. I emailed their customer service and they replied quickly, saying that I had ordered after 12pm so therefore it would come two days later, not one. This was fine for me, but the website had told me if I paid for next day, I would receive it the next day, so  it would have been a lot more useful if they actually made this delivery date estimate  more accurate. I did email them back asking if I could have my next day delivery fee refunded as it didn’t come the next day and this could have been very inconvenient for me however I was told it wasn’t possible.Overall, ASOS has a great range of products and uses partially recycled delivery packaging ( a bonus !) , their customer service was good, however I would have liked more details on the next day delivery as I had paid it all for nothing !

            The clothes are great but the customer service is diabolical I have contacted customer service several times with ASOS and I can honestly say it is THE WORST CS I've ever received. None of my needs have ever been met and I am and have been for many years, a regular customer. I have NEVER felt valued and the last time was no different. I was offered to pay for a service on the UK site for free 2 day delivery to US (I moved there recently). Thought that was great so I did pay for only to be told after trying to get answers for over a week that even though premier delivery two shipping to the US only to be told that in fact I cannot use it on the UK site and there was nothing they were going to do about it. Asos won't even refund me the $12! It's not the money..its the gesture. I don't need $12 feel that it is a fair to offer that solution to me. I believe this is terrible customer service and just adds to the long line to bad service I've received for years. I've tweeted, I've gone online, I've emailed. No difference in the poor level of service. And to top it off they have no complaints department. I have repeatedly ask to lodge a formal complaint, all with written evidence to back up my claims but the care team tell me there is no complaints department but have been assured that I've 'been heard' and 'thank you for the feedback'!

            Today I made a purchase with a promo code for almost $200. Immediately after the purchase completed I noticed it was shipping standard and not express as I had indicated. I engaged chat, which is the only option available b/c unlike the thousands of other online shopping services, they don't have a phone #. Okay. So, the first customer rep said I need to wait an hour b/c my order was ""not in the system"", and then chat back. I did so. The second rep I spoke to was so rude and robotic and just keep quoting policy without any concern, saying I ""missed the cancellation period."" What?! I only missed it b/c of what I was told earlier. Then she started blaming me for entering the promo, but not ""claiming it properly"", and hung up on me mid-chat. I spoke with 3 customer service reps, and only the third was helpful, but by that time it was too late to do anything. This seriously can not be how ASOS treats customers. They couldn't even handle the most basic inquiry. There was literally nothing that could be accomplished. I have no clue why they even have a customer service system. You can't speak with a live person. You can't CHANGE ANYTHING, and the only thing they can do is cancel your order, oh, but only in the first 5min to an hour! ...great selection on ASOS, but worst customer service ever. Be careful before you purchase anything, you will get no assistance what-so-ever.

            I have ordered from ASOS for years but just recently I have found their customer service unacceptable. I placed an order for £100 using my premier delivery. I received an email to say my order would be with me the next day. It never arrived. I called Asos the following day to be told by Julie that I have to wait a further 4 working days (5 in total) and if my order doesn’t turn up I should then call for them to refund or replace. I expressed that this is not what I would expect for next day delivery. She then told me that apparently this is all in my terms and conditions. So please beware do not rely on next day delivery or that Asos will have any interest in assisting you in the event your order goes missing but they are quite happy to keep my £100 for a further 4 days before they will even try and resolve this for me.Update..the items arrived 5 days later in Hermes packaging with no returns label or sheet. Two items missing and two faulty. They sent out the missing items which took a further 3 days. The faulty items had clearly been worn, had no tags on and looked like they had come out of someone’s wash basket. One was discoloured and the other had faulty buttons. I was asked to return these for replacements to be sent. I returned them once I printed my own returns label and sheet, requesting replacements. I received an email yesterday telling me my refund had been processed for £4! The items o returned amounted to £24. As I had used a spend and save voucher they have removed my discount from the whole order and refunded me only £4. I queried why they have refunded when I wanted replacements only to be told the items were out of stock. This was a complete lie because I checked and both had plenty of stock. Anyway all they could offer me was another promo code so I’d have to spend another £100...I think not!!! Absolutely terrible Asos!!!

The brand and Asos ethos seems to have deteriorated.Latest issue that means I will no longer be shopping with them is; had an order delivered that was left outside in my garden, even though the porch was noted as the safe space. Apparently because I have said they can leave in a safe space that means the parcel is my responsibility regardless of the fact the courier left it in view of a busy street and was stolen, and they will not refund or send a replacement! Message after message I have sent and I have no idea why they cannot do something, I even have the images showing how the courier left the parcel as they were sent as an update through the couriers app!

            I have been an ASOS customer for years. In the last year the company has went right down hill. No longer get points (VIP), customer service getting worse, late deliveries and lack of real ''Sales''.I am no longer going to order from them. Latest issue is that my last 2 orders have been cancelled due to items being out of stock after placing the order but holding onto your money for a few days first before telling me item is no longer available. After receiving notification from them that item is out of stock and them cancelling my order the item/s 24 hours later remarkably come back in stock, but the sale or the voucher you used on the original order has expired so if you want to order again then its full price.

It's a good store, but if you have any trouble along the way, you are in for a ride. Besides every customer service rep being rude and off putting, I have never been able to get any help from them.

The issue is not that, but that I didn't even get any update on it. I had to chat with ASOS to be told oh you'll have to wait two weeks without any other explanation. I then sent a follow-up email, 6x and got no response. I then tried chatting with them again to be told the same thing and that perhaps I missed the shipping confirmation email to my spam or their other email responses.

            Dear ASOS, I am writing this hoping that someone will see it and be able to help me as I find myself in the worst experience I have ever had with an online store. I placed an order with ASOS on Monday March 19th and received it not long after that. After trying the different items within this order I decided to return some things.When I went to return this order I had realised that the card I used to buy these items was stolen from me. Because that card was stolen from me I closed the bank account associated with that card. That bank account was closed on April 3rd. I notified your customer service team about this before returning these items and you assured me that it would not be an issue and that you would help me obtain my refund. Once the refund was ""processed"" you had informed me that the bank account that I had closed accepted the refund and that I needed to get in contact with that bank in order to receive my refund. I went into the bank and told them what you had said and they told me that my bank account was indeed closed and that it was impossible for any funds to have gone into it. They double checked and confirmed that there was no refund. I replied back and told you this, you told me to go back to the bank and have them right a personal letter stating that my bank account was closed (this after I already gave you my closing bank statement). I went back to the bank and explained to them what you requested of me. They explained that they never do this and that I should only need a closing bank statement. After much discussion they finally gave me a personal letter stating that my bank account was indeed closed on April 3rd. I gave you this letter and you agreed to do a ""one off"" to refund me to my current bank account.Fast forward to now. I decided to make a second return on that same order on April 26th. I wanted to avoid any sort of confusion & frustration on this second return as it was purchased on the same stolen card/bank account. To be safe I got in contact with your customer care team and asked them to help make sure that the refund didn't go to that old card (which i deleted off my account because you said it would solve issues). You promised me that if there were any issues that you would help me get my refund to my current bank account.Sure enough, the same thing happened the second time as did the first. You replied to me saying that my old bank account had accepted my refund. Frustrated at this point I contacted you again and explained that this bank account was closed and it had been closed since April 3rd. Since that contact with you I have had 24 back and forth emails, 15 online chat sessions, DM's to your social media accounts, 2 calls from your team telling me to go back into the bank, gone back and forth to and from the bank having them write multiple letters telling you that they don't have my refund money and I am so far beyond frustrated. You constantly tell me to do something to prove that they don't have the money, then I do that and you still tell me that there is nothing you can do. The simple reality is that I don't have my refund and you have made me go through so many loops over these last couple of months to try and obtain it. I have done everything that you have requested and it still isnt enough for you to give me my proper refund. WHEN WILL YOU GIVE ME MY REFUND? Please have someone who has common sense look at my case and organise my refund. I have tried to be nice but after months of this and over 50 forms of communication I am at the end of my rope. I am severely disappointed in the way I have been treated and I am sure I am not the only one.

            Same as previous reviewers - got an email threatening to deactivate account. I have only returned one item in the three years i've used them.  when i questioned them, they tried to play it down but not apologising for wasting my time [i thought someone had accessed my account fraudulently].  Useless marketing team and useless customer care.  When i asked them to deactivate my account, i then got a message back saying Customer care will be in touch. I won't hold my breath.......

            I got the same email today as the previous reviewer here. Threatening to deactivate my account and lumping me in the same category with people who ""return clothes they can't use,"" even though every garment I buy, I return after gently trying on once.  I've also only made three orders ever, and the main reason I returned the Aso brand clothes that I bought was because they looked cheap.   One of the Aso design tops was a satin camisole. I liked it, but it had this weird facing at the top that ended at my nipples and made them look pointy.  I've been willing to keep giving them a chance because the site is convenient and there are lots of brands on their site to choose from. My guess would be a successful purchase is hit-or-miss, but after this treatment I will not be shopping with them anymore or supporting their business. If they are trying to scare away customers with their fear-mongering tactics, then they are doing a great job.I digress, the point it threatening your customers is a terrible business strategy.  I can't explain how angry it makes me that a business I've purchased from, return or not, would attempt to threaten. Maybe their business isn't doing so great and they've gotten desperate. It doesn't matter because I no longer support them.

            ASOS emailed me today stating I return too many items and they might deactivate my account. Firstly, I have barely ordered anything from your overpriced fast-fashion website this year. Secondly I only keep quality items that I really like, so if Im returning most of my orders its probably because your clothing quality sucks, your website photos aren’t accurate or the item doesn’t fit right (since most items you sell are the hipster shape). Thirdly I cannot teleport to your warehouse and try on your items, so of course I will have to return orders if the clothes don’t suit me. I prefer a minimalist wardrobe with quality garments that I will enjoy wearing every day, which means my environmental impact is greatly reduced. Furthermore I buy most of my clothes from second hand shops, as charity shops offer better quality garments than ASOS, at cheaper prices and they aren’t pumping out new clothes for profit. So please ASOS get your facts straight!

            Awful awful customer service. Very smug and zero effort. Despite paying £10 for next day delivery,  it’s now due to arrive another week from now. The representatives I spoke to about this shrugged it off and said, well you’ll have to wait the week, nothing we can do and shut the chat.

            I would give them a zero if it was possible. I ordered on the 22nd of May and was supposed to receive the dress on the 11th of June. I tried to communicate with their customer service and they refused to give me a tracking number and they advised that i should look in my neighborhood and the postal office. I checked both but in vain. They advised that i shall wait till the 1st of July and they will not do anything before that because it is their procedure. Noting that i had the event that i am supposed to wear the dress that i ordered on the 24th of June. I had to buy another one from some place else in a short period of time! and they wouldn't careless. They are just robots answering the inquiry and when i tried to escalate my issue they said no escalations and they ended the chat immediately!

Wrote numerous of times to support and still do not understand if they shipped it or no. No tracking number provided. Last time contacted support 4 days ago - no respond till now.

            I am paying for premium delivery with Asos, which means orders are supposed to be delivered the next working day. However have placed an order on June 20 and as of today, July 1st, the order has not even been shipped from their warehouse and every time i try to contact someone about it through chat, email etc. they just say that they are very happy to look into this issue for me and will get back to me, and then nothing happens. Extremely poor customer service.

            I had the worst experience with asos. I bought four items on the 10th of June 2019. On the 14th I received an e-mail with a tracking number. On the 19th the tracking device stated that the parcel would be delivered on the 19th. But nothing happened and the parcel didn't get delivered. So I wrote to customer service, who asked me to hold my patience until the 27th. On the 27th the parcel still wasn't delivered. So I wrote again on the the 27th and the 28th, but with no answer. Again I wrote on the 1st of July - this time with reply. Apparently the parcel had been lost. So instead they ordered a replacement order. But in the meantime one of the items had been sold out, so this wouldn't be included in the new order. Furthermore two of the items were ordered with wrong sizes. So again I had to write customer-service to have this fixed. Apparently the e-mail had wrongly stated that the sold-out item would not be included as it was actually one of the other items with the wrong size. As regards he other item with the wrong size at first they wouldn't admit that they had ordered it wrong, but as they admitted the size was actually wrong, they didn't want to do anything about it even though I wrote to them less than an hour after receiving the e-mail regarding the replacement order. So now I'm receiving an item that dosen't fit and I have to use more useless time on returning it. This whole experience have been so confusing and with such bad service. I will NEVER recommend anyone to order from ASOS. Their service is the worst.

            I recently returned an item, which after 20 days has not been acknowledged or refunded. I will have to wait 10 for the funds to be returned once they process the return. Unfortunately I foolishly and without thinking placed another order, which will take 8 days before being delivered. Despite the long wait, the money has been taken and I am not able to cancel the order 3 hours later. I now realise that after waiting 8 days, if I send back immediately, it will take 9 days for the process the return and a further 10 days for money to be refunded. That's a total of 26 days that ASOS have my money. Much if this is because they are 'busier than usual' so have changed their terms & conditions. I for one will help them to reduce quite how busy they are by taking my custom elsewhere; perhaps others feel the same? Absolutely atrocious turnaround in what was previously a great level of service

            TBH, I never had a bad experience with ASOS. Also they are lifesavers if you live somewhere abroad, where they don't have a good selection of clothing stores. Their delivery is cheap and I never had problems with it. The returns are super simple and the product selection is great. As a petite girl, I absolutely love it.

            Orders don't arrive on time and the customer service robots refuse to send me a tracking number for my order or even apologize for this situation. Seems like my order has not yet been shipped at all and the estimated arrival date has gone and went. This doesn't stop the worthless customer service lying to me about postal service being slow and blaming this mess on them. If you dimwits haven't even sent the order yet, how can you blame the delay on the postal service and how you even dare lie about the status of the order? This is absolute crap and no one should ever order anything from them. I've had good experiences with Asos in the past but now it seems like the whole company is fu***d and I will never order from them again. I hope that my Paypal claim will sort this stupid mess out and refund me my money, screw Asos.

            I've ordered with a next day delivery service  (which cost an extra £8 cost), i've waited until 8pm , then called the customer service, they told me to wait until 10pm. It is now 10:57pm and still no order.I've contacted AGAIN the customer service to receive an update. They said that i will receive my order 5 days later due to a delay ... Couldn't they have explained to me that over the phone ?? or email me ? I've asked to cancel my order as i will then be away, they've been unhelpful saying that after delivery attempts the package will be returned to them .... how long will i then have to wait until a receive my refund ? this is a mystery. All these inconvenience that I the customer have to swallow, without even an apology. Can't guarantee a delivery and bad customer service experience Also they did not offer to refund my express delivery fees (as it was not delivered as per the delivery window) , which would have been expected and received with any other online store.Usually a fervent and loyal customer to ASOS, but this time the customer service went down by 100 points. Won't shop again.

The customer service agent was so rude! Not even an apology!  Said I couldn't speak witn anyone, and that I couldn't deal with anyone else. The order than took over 7 days to arrive I contacted customer service to be told they are busy! Again no apology at all! The items arrived and wish are better quality and the sizing is awful! I returned the whole £75 order the next day. I have now been told 10 days later by another rude customer service agent that it takes 9 working days to get back to them and a further 7 days for them to refund you. But they are busy at this time so these times will be longer!!!! Never ordering again! Out £75 for a month so far! (Due to paying twice in the first place!)

            So here's the thing with Asos. Clothes may not look the same as they did online and quality might not be as good as expected when you buy the cheapest brands they offer. You may get lucky though and get some cheap nice stuff, it's not all bad quality in my experience. They do offer other quality brands you can buy albeit for a higher price point. You get what you pay for, and a 5 quid jumper is not going to be great and not a reason to moan online.Shipping is quick and returns are easy. You can use the same packaging they used to send your stuff, it comes with a slip you can fill in and you only need to drop it off at the post office. Once they receive your return, they'll refund you pretty quick. This has happened to me a few times and I've never had any issues with it. However, if you try to get any customer service from them it's only going to make things difficult for you. It's slow and useless, so don't even try. If you have any issues just return the item for a refund, if you need a smaller size just buy a new one and return the other one. The returns process is so easy that it's not worth getting worked up over their customer service.

Ordered $300 worth of items and promised a free 2 day shipping. Ordered on 6/19 and still have not received my items. The estimated delivery date is 7/6. Over 2 weeks. Contacted customer service, worse experience with 0 help. Refused to recall my order and provide a refund. I know they did not send it with 2 day delivery.I decided to order the same items yesterday and PAID for the 2 day shipping option and surprise, no not at all actually. My items have shipped out with an estimated delivery date of Monday 7/1. I paid so now they will honor the 2 day shipping but the free 2 day shipping with a minimum purchase amount is a lie. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau, this is poor and deceptive business practices. Shame on you Asos for misleading your customers just so they will spend more without the intent of honoring the free 2 day shipping.

            I've been using asos for years and for the most part, everything works fine and no complaints.However, I recently made an order with next day delivery. It just never dispatched. Asos' order page hasn't changed its status from ""We've got it!"", I haven't received an email that it's been dispatched nor have I received any notifications from any carriers saying I have a package on the way.Customer service is f***** worthless. They give you a copy paste response about checking with your neighbours and post office. If you're not happy with this response, they will tell you to wait until the end of the day/wait until tomorrow/wait until this weekend/etc etc just so you leave.Finally, my order was forwarded to their ""specialist team"" and you get no confirmation of this. Just sit and wait hoping this autistic seal team 6 finally gets in touch with you. I was told 24-48 hours for a specialist team response and 5 days later with no response, I get back in touch with support.They tell me that I cannot get a refund for my order until this ""specialist team"" looks into what went wrong. What the f***. My order was never dispatched and it's 2 weeks past my original order date (with next day delivery) and they are telling me I can't have my money back for an order they never f****** sent out. They basically took my money, gave me nothing and still just tell me to wait.The cherry on top is when they told me that because I contacted support again after 5 days of no response, I am relegated to the back of the support queue, meaning I have to start my wait for this magical specialist team all over again.Absolutely f****** absurd, luckily I paid via PayPal and will be issuing a chargeback through them. Again, usually everything goes fine but God forbid something goes wrong and they just try to f*** you and f*** with you in every which way they can. It's absurd how f****** braindead their customer service policies are. Instead of helping a long term customer who has spent hundreds and thousands over the years and would continue to shop with them, they f*** them over on their own mistake for a £50 order. Way to lose a customer, hope it was worth it.

            I have just attempted to inquire about returning a faulty item purchased from ASOS. It took the chat consultant almost 20 minutes to tell me they couldn't actually help me! All this person did was elevate the issue to a 'specialist team' who will respond to me within a lightning 24 hours, then couldn't tell me why a specialist team was even necessary. It's a simple return. Apparently ASOS pride themselves on their easy and fast returns - fail to see how. When I asked the consultant why their responses were taking so long, they (eventually) suggested it was my internet connection. I suggested it might be theirs and they quite arrogantly asserted they were not experiencing any issues at that time. When I queried that, the consultant (suddenly quite rapidly) informed me that they were dealing with more than one customer at a time. I suggest therein lies the problem and that ASOS don't employ enough customer service consultants, they have a clunky and inefficient internal process for addressing returns/issues, and certainly either don't give customer service staff appropriate customer service training, or don't actually monitor the quality of their service. At no point did this person apologise for any delays or my dissatisfaction with the responses provided. Hopeless. ASOS, there are many, many other online market places who have excellent and efficient customer service, so it's time to step up.

            ASOS has such a bad customer service that I can't give them even a star . They definitely deserve less negative rating from my side. I was checking for my returns on their chat box but they were responding after 15 minutes . I pinged her twice or thrice just to remind her that I am waiting for her reply. Also when I asked her query she gave me only specific response and did not make efforts to clarify my queries .I asked her if she could divert me to specific person who can clarify my queries but she jut ended chat .I wish I could attach screenshot of our chat here. \rfeally upset with their service . I do not want to buy from ASOS now only because of their customer service.

            Im so surprised at some of the reviews on here. Maybe Ive been fortunate, as Ive nothing but praise for ASOS UK. I've been a regular customer for three years. I purchase on average four dresses per month and have never had an issue regarding returns nor delivery. I paid for Express Delivery which is £9.99 for 12 months and can say that ASOS have never let me down. Unlike other online stores, the return process is easy and well managed as there are a great many options for returns which is very convenient. Once they receive your item, they send an email confirmation, and adivse when your money will be refunded.My number one shopping brand, as they are prompt with good value for money and a knowledgeable customer service team.

            Easy to order, delivery was quick (used Click and Collect) and the dress was of good quality. Unfortunately I had to return it (free), as the bridesmaid had already bought her own dress. The refund was prompt. I will use them again in future.

            Has anyone else ordered “next-day-delivery” for a year, and The first order never came? I’ve made an order The 21th, which should be delivered The 24th. But it never came, and hasn’t been marked as “sent” it’s still “we’ve Got it”, NOT “we’ve sent it”. And there aint no tracking available. I’ve contacted customer service serval times, and asos sent me an e-mail The 24th to let me now it was one day delayed, and if I didn’t have it next day i should contact them again - so I did! Because it never came. Everyone writes “i will look into this” but I never Got any further messages. So I contacted The chat - where “JOE” claims my package has been delivered, but won’t give me any tracking number to proof it. I’ve been looking everywhere outside, been asking neighbours and contacted UPS and PostNord (local postoffice) but as long as i don’t have any tracking number they can’t help me. They tell me to contact asos - which I’ve done EVERY single day, with no help. It’s my 50+ order - so i’m a loyal customer and have been it for many years. When i try to e-mail customer service and choose The order I don’t have (but Asos claims has been delivered) it even says : “it looks like our costumer Care team need to help you with this one - just fill out the box below with any more information and submit your query.”This plus The “we’ve Got it” in-sted of “we’ve sent it” should be proof enough to listen to me. But they don’t. And I can’t check with post offices or UPS before asos are giving me a tracking number. Anyone else tried it? And how did it go? To me The 1000 dkkr spent on something i’m not getting is many money, it was a summer cheer up gift, but now it’s The most frustrating thing ever, having to write mails every day, with The same answers and no action. Didn’t thought asos would ever be my worst internet shopping nightmare. It was my fav place. This experience really broke my heart.

            I placed an order for approximately 11 items on 6/14/19. I had recently moved states and at checkout entered my new address. My items were supposed to be delivered on 6/26/19. When they hadn't arrived by 6/27/19, I checked the tracking status to discover they had been delivered to my old address, over 1000 miles away. I contacted customer service via chat (because they do not provide a phone number, I assume that's because they experience so many issues) and explained their system had made a mistake and delivered my package to my old address. My correct delivery address is on my profile on their site, and it could not be there unless I had entered it when I placed my order as I had not previously ordered from this address. Customer service told me I would need to retrieve the package myself or have the new tenant return the package to ASOS at which point they would give me a refund. When I explained that neither option was possible as I now lived over 1000 miles away and did not know the new tenant and had no way of contacting them to retrieve my package, they told me there was nothing else they could do. When I requested that I be transferred to their management, they refused. When I asked what I was supposed to do, they said the new tenant at my old address may return it to ASOS. I explained this was not plausible and that I needed to be issued a refund as I hadn't received the products I paid for and it was due to an error on their end, they replied that ""sometimes it happens."" I insisted that I be refunded my money and they cut off the chat, when I started another chat they left me on hold for as long as they could, and then repeated the same lines and cut off the chat again. So I have now paid over $160 and haven't received a single thread of clothing. They are stealing from customers. DO NOT TRUST THEM AND DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS. There are far too many online clothing companies to order from such a shady business that won't own up to their mistakes and take care of their customers.

            I’ve used ASOS for years now but am disgusted by my recent experience. I ordered using immediate delivery and my parcel never arrived (despite the delivery company saying it was delivered). It had evidently went to the wrong address (no one lives in my building under the name it was signed for). I fought for over a week to get a refund but ASOS still won’t refund postage (cost nearly £10). They are saying I have 13 successful premium deliveries so won’t refund, however, this was not premium delivery and instead immediate. I’ve been passed to and from different customer service advisors with a different one answering each correspondence- each one appearing clueless as to what is going on. I shouldn’t have to fight for a refund when they are at fault neither should I feel accused of not being able to locate my parcel/not being in to collect it (which I was)/ made to feel like I’m lying!

            I too don’t even want to give them 1 star. This is the second time this has happened to me over the past year. I ordered with a week in advance of when I needed the item to arrive (tomorrow), and was expecting a shipping email during the week. I messaged yesterday asking for an update on where my parcel was and they gave me no useful information, and frankly were very rude! I asked if it would still be likely to arrive on Friday and she said ‘well that’s why there’s a next day delivery option, of course it’s possible’. To come out of working having received an email at 10am saying that my refund had been successful?! I did not even receive the item, let alone return it. So I contacted customer services and again, the same copy and paste replies, and he was absolutely useless. So my order has been cancelled without my knowledge, and they had no solution or compensation on how to make it better after waiting a week! What’s worse is that I’ve been charged for bloody delivery when I haven’t even received something! Fuming. Very frustrated and disappointed. Never ordering from their rubbish website again.

            It's a pity that they are normally very good at deliveries, but if something goes wrong, they don't know what to do and besides nice words, there's no help or support in their customer service.

            I didn't want to be one of those that gives bad review to a good service as soon as one problem arises however because my last order is giving me so much stress I couldnt help. Normally Asos always took 5-6 days for delivery in my previous 15 orders. Trusting it will go well again i placed my order 2 weeks prior to my holiday. After seein it's not been dispatched aftr 5 days of my order i enquired and received a generic email promising only 2-3 days of delay and i realized the new delivery date kept getting pushed away every time i asked about my package. now i want to cancel but there's no such option. After reading many comments from people that have been waiting for more than a month and still no news, i lost hope. I will not shop from Asos again and advise people not to until they change their cancellation policy.

            They changed return policy recently in some countries so it's not free anymore to return unwanted items. Return fee is ridiculously expensive. At the time I placed my order, the return was still free and they still advertised to have free return on their website. That's why I ordered one items in 2 different sizes to see which one fits me better. But when I tried to create a return label, it was no longer fee. I understand that I'll have to pay to return if I had placed the order after they changed the policy. But in my case, I felt like I was lied to. I contacted their customer support and they weren't helpful at all, just replied as if they were robots. I'll not shop at Asos anymore after this customer service catastrophe.

            If I can give zero stars I would. For a company worth 2.4 billion GBP, you have terrible, non-existent customer service. Despite having a proof that I had returned an item and it was received by ASOS according to the tracking number, ASOS has not refunded my money. If ASOS' business model is to scam people by taking returns and not refunding money, then I should probably gather all the persons on TrustPilot who has not received their refunds and file for a class action lawsuit. Terrible company. I will never ever do business with ASOS again.

            Horrible, horrible people: Asos. First of all, the only way to contact them is via social media, which would've been ok, if they had real human beings monitoring these things. Over the years I've bought great stuff from them and hardly had any problem, even though I've had to pay exorbitant customs fees. I still continued shopping with them, as I love the quality stuff they sell. In recent years, Asos seems to have gotten too conceited for their own good. On May 22, I made a purchase , received an email May 24, saying my order has been shipped. To date I haven't received the item and no one will give me a definitive answer, besides wait until July 2nd before anything can be done. I keep messaging them asking for an answer, it appears they've become tired of me. Now they only send out the same old computer activated message saying: Check with neighbours, etc. Which is impossible, my purchase all go to Penguin Pickup. I purchase the same item again as  I really need it, they did not even send me an email confirmation. The only proof I have is my credit card charge. I asked why, they sent me the same tired message. No Canadian  or US company has ever treated me this way! I won't be buying from Asos again. There are too many other online retailers with better business sense and respect for customers!

            ASOS used to be such a reliable and customer friendly company! They’ve now got so big they only see pound signs! I won’t be ordering from them again and neither will my family.In the space of 2 weeks I placed 2 orders, the first one, 4 days after I ordered I got an email saying 1 of the items is out of stock so I won’t be getting that. Then it turned up late. The second order turned up with the wrong pair of shoes.I contacted live chat customer service and was just met with copy and paste responses, barely an apology. And just told to send back and I can get a refund. Then the chat cut off. They used to care if you received the wrong item and send you the correct one out straight away with the condition you return the wrong item within a certain time. They have lost their personal touch, I don’t feel like a valued customer anymore. I’ve been using Asos since it first was set up. But this will be the last time. Greedy company, no care for customers and awful customer service.

            they ship with whatever service they want regardless of the one you asked for. it’s the second time I had my items shipped through dhl even if I selected the free shipping method. this results in an overcharge of fees and duties since dhl requests 15$ just to accept the package into their system. my point is, i never asked for dhl so why ship my items through it? I don’t understand the point. also, i could careless about getting my items in two days. i never expect fast shipping when shopping overseas. they pay all duties and taxes for american customers but charge us whatever they want while claiming to have our best interests at heart by throwing us 15% off.

            ive been using ASOS since 2010 and i can honestly say its been a bit of a lifesaver when it comes to online shopping. But it does have its cons as well!ProsThe product selection grows from year to year and I know that when the high street lets me down I can always rely on ASOS to deliver something i like!premier delivery - £9.99 for a year is worth every penny, over 9 years i have only ever had a small hand full of delivery issues and i think it might be due to me using premier delivery - guaranteed next day delivery and an easy returns process (as far as ticking a box and sticking a return label on the front!) my area delivers Asos via DPD which i don't really get many problems with.a mixture of own brand and high street products - well why pay for delivery on that item I want from river island or new look if they have it on ASOS and you get free delivery?ConsSizing and sells outs - considering how big asos are I do think they need to up their game when it comes to getting accurate sizing details and replenishment of sell-out items - as a customer there is nothing worse than finding something you love... then seeing its only available in a UK size 4...customer service - over the past 9 years the customer service has definitely taken a turn for the worst. Response times are not great and then the physical responses are so scripted it defeats the point in trying to contact them....delivery - when i do on occasion have a delivery issue (mainly with Hermes!) ASOS are not at all helpful and state the issue lies with the courier (which it does 9 times out of 10) but i feel that asos should take on a bit more responsibility - especially when you look through these reviews and can see that the vast majority are due to delivery or logistic issues

Now I can’t return the jeans.Out of 3 items, only 1 item I’m satisfied as done by other brand (Collusion).

            I USED to shop at ASOS religiously because their stuff was so affordable and great for a grad student like me on a budget. I’ve never had an issue with returns. Normally I get the package, try on the clothes, and send back what I didn’t like the next day. They include postage in the package so all you have to do is put it on the package and drop it off at a usps drop off. WELL a couple of weeks ago I got a package and I didn’t like 2 of the items. So I did what I always do, drop it off at the blue usps drop off. It’s been well over 10 business days and I have yet to see a credit or a return email for my items. I contacted customer service and they pretty much told me that because I didn't have PROOF OF POSTAGE, they couldn’t do anything. Why would I need proof of postage when ASOS sent me the postage? I’m sure a lot of people do not get proof of postage because it’s supposed to be an “easy return”. You’re a real joke ASOS.

            I would give 0 stars if I could. Ordered back in May & received an email the next day advising my order had been shipped. It was supposed to be received by June 11 at the latest. I’m still waiting. 2 chats & 1 email later & I have no information. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They just say to keep waiting. Will NEVER purchase from them again. 😡

            since the 2nd June I've been waiting for my refund of £75. Still not been received but advised it takes 5-10 working days...6 emails chasing them, 3 web chats and 2 telephone calls (which cost £6 per connected call) and still nothing.Would never use them again - was going to buy wedding suits up £2,000 - they have lost that business.

            Terrible quality control. Unfortunately two of the three things that I ordered were faulty; one with two rips and the other missing a slip. The customer service was extremely unhelpful and obviously are not trying to keep repeat customers. Not recommended, better to go and buy cheap clothes at H & M.

            Increasingly more frustrated with asos. I spend a fortune with the company and lately appealed that free delivery takes over a week now to come.....even in the uk. They have got rid of all perks for frequent customers and their competitors are increasingly filling their downfalls! Ontop of which i ordered an item last week to be told the click and collect was sent back to their warehouse....not informing me...told me ill get money when it returns and i was told i need to reorder it until then. This is absrud. I am now out of pocket. What happened to customer service...i asked for at least a next day delivery code so i wasnt waiting a week to get it back...... and no they said. Absolutely appauling

            I ordered a dress from ASOS for a wedding in 2 days. The dress arrived the next day and was infact not the dress I ordered. This was a completely different style and colour.I immediately contacted them to see if anything could be done for me as the wedding was now tomorrow and I had no outfit. I explained I will post it back to them and show proof of postage, but they refused to post a new one out to me so I could have something to wear.Customer service on Facebook was terrible! In the space of an hour, I had spoken to 4 different employees, all of whom told me to post the dress back and wait for a refund to be processed. No compassion or consideration for my situation in the slightest.I then requested to be compensated with a discount code as I would now need to purchase a new dress for tomorrow and pay for next day delivery again, only to be told I couldn't have one. Luckily I called them rather than dealing with the imbecile's on Facebook chat, and I spoke to a lovely gent who was shocked at the appalling approach the staff had on social media. He immediately gave me a 15% discount code to use when I wish and refunded the next day delivery to me.Think the staff who deal with Facebook chat need re-training and an attitude adjustment. They still havent replied to my last message which I sent 4 weeks ago aha!

            Have been a consistent customer with ASOS for years, despite constant faults in my orders and deliveries, with some products not even being able to be located. But this was really the final straw. I ordered a Lacoste hoodie, blue size small. It turned up and was a large! Under the consumer rights act, it broke almost every assurance. My first day delivery was negligible as I had to wait over a week for a refund, I could no longer use my 20% universal or 25% student code (as every person has limited finances) and the ASOS team refuse to allow you to speak to anyone over a phone. All of their responses via messenger are automated and their customer care team doesn’t even reply to email complaints.Appalling service from a disorganised company. No wonder they’ve had 2 warehouse fires, with this lack of planning.Shame.

            Hi,I have been a loyal customer to Asos for over 4 years now and have recently been experiences issues with a delay in delivery. I understand and am well aware that deliveries are of no fault of the company and understand that some circumstances are unforseen. However, when sharing my concern and complaints to Asos about a delivery which had been 4 days late (having paid for a yearly subscription of £9.99), their simple response was they could not do anything about it and rather I should wait until an additional 4 days maximum to receive me order. The team were well aware that they had put me at great inconvenience however, were adamant they could do nothing to compensate for the inconvenience they had caused. This is a re occuring issue I have been facing with Asos recently, and as a former loyal customer to them advise you buy your item else where as the customer service you will receive is likely to be much better. Kind regards.

            I had placed an order 4 days ago with asos and it is yet to be despatched even though it said it would be with me this weekend (definitely not happening) I have live chatted numerous times with people, one of which couldn’t be bothered replying after me waiting 10 minutes for a response. I then emailed the company to explain my frustration and to cancel my order immediately as I had placed an order with another website and received it the next day. They are refusing to cancel my order because my order is packed (it’s been packed since Tuesday apparently) this is possibly the worst experience and service I have ever had to deal with. The most arrogant and rude customer “help” team. I will be taking this further as I am within my rights to cancel my order and receive a refund which they are REFUSING to do.

I have contacted the delivery company and they have not received the package too.The customer support is literally the worst I've ever met. They had no information regarding the package and did not agree to refund.After several days, they told me that the package will be returned to them. Wanna know what happened next? I've received the package in two days after it happened.The items are great, the overall experience is not so good. If you do not care about delivery time and so on, feel free to order items but do not hope that CS will help you.

            EDIT (4/7/2019): After waiting for the amount of time they required they sent my order again on the 1st of July and it arrived today.What the f happened to ASOS? I've been waiting for 20 days (order date: 1st of June) on a 120 euros order and I live in Europe - it's not even dispatched yet. I mean come on! The warehouse is in Germany, I'm in Greece. And of course the customer service is terrible, only scripted answers and if they're pushed in the corner they sign off. I mean I would love to know if there's a problem with an item I ordered (availability etc.), or a problem with the warehouse, or anything to be honest. I would love to know a reason for the delay. But no! They tell me to just wait! And if the date they provide passes they tell me to check with my neighbours or check safe places. They don't deliver parcels in Greece without first making sure you're at home to receive it! They don't leave it laying like that! I've even called the delivery service and they can't find the order in their system. I filed a claim with PayPal, I hope I'll get my money back or until then, my order. The thing is I ordered a backpack which costed 14 euros while I was in Brussels during Christmas and I had a problem with the delivery and then the costumer service was just fine, they refunded and everything. What happened from Christmas till now?

Orders some gear for Next Day delivery but when tracked it showed that the goods hadn't been collected. Contacted ASOS and was told the goods were Out for Delivery. I questioned this and was still told they would be delivered. Never showed and the goods weren't collected from ASOS until 15.28pm on the day they were supposed to be Delivered. Spoke to Customer service again to be told they cant do anything and would even admit they gave out incorrect info! Will never use ASOS again!!!!

            I have purchased with asos for years. Never really having too many issues with them or postage or their customer service. I don't order too often (in fact only 3 times this year 2019 and we are 6 months into the year) SO NOT often. My recent purchase i ordered 3 items - which were sent. 2 of the items did not fit so within hours of receiving i lodged the return and sent it back immediately the next morning. This was 10 days ago. The returns are local and almost immediate usually. After enquiring I have had excuse after excuse. Even providing them with the return receipt of delivery. Their excuse is that its in another suburb 10 minutes away.  PATHETIC. Obviously they have a large volume of returns and issues with people wearing and returning - i literally lodged the return 2 hours after i received it - because i was at work. MY OTHE CONCERN is that none of the items sent to me had tags. I also wrote a note to state my concerns and that they looked worn.   Last time ill ever shop with them YUK.

            Been shopping with Asos since 2008 and can honestly say the quality of the items has gone down.Not had any issues in regard to delivery, maybe some delayed returns but nothing major and I think having a premier account help.However, the standard of the items being sent out are terrible. They're clearly sending out returns that are not up to the standard any customer would be happy with- tearing/ threads coming out, shoes obviously scuffed and look worn, no paper stuffing in the shoe (baring in mind I've ordered the same pair more than once to see if i have any lucky with the quality) and I've noticed recently when its ""low in stock"" depending what the item is- word of warning, expect to be sent a returned item that will likely already look worn /scuffed or stretched. Really disappointed with the standard of Asos recently. Your best bet is going for new full priced items on the website as the stock will be new/fresh- meaning theres less chance or being sent someone else's returns

            I wish I could give this company no stars. They're absolute frauds and scammers. I ordered an item over a month ago, which was supposed to be delivered this past Monday June 17th, the item never came. So I contacted their ""chat team"" only to have automated responses given back to me. A team member from the chat then advised me they would look into the matter and I would receive an email within 24 hours. That of course, didn't happen. So I contacted them again today June 19th only for another team member from their chat tell me they in fact did not even have my order and I was going to receive a refund! What?!?! So, on the 17th one person is telling me my order has been shipped and will arrive any day now, then on the 19th another person is telling me I'm being refunded?! SMELLS LIKE A SCAM! So I then asked for proof of a refund several times, only to be denied any email of any sort of proof that I will be refunded.

            I have never had any issues with Asos until very recently. I have premier delivery so that I can chose when my parcels are delivered as I work full time. I recently managed to order a dress before it sold out and ordered it for next day delivery, a Sunday so I would be home for the package. Hermes didn’t attempt to deliver the package until Tuesday- once at 11am and once at 2pm. Not very clever for all of us who work. I altered the delivery to a neighbour but you can only chose one neighbour.. the one I chose also wasn’t in. Hermes only try three times and state this will usually be over three working days.. mine was two and the package was two days late. Sold out dress has been returned to Asos. I spoke to Asos customer services who were very unhelpful and super defensive. No apology- I couldn’t believe such a big brand has such poor customer care. It has really put me off shopping with them again.

            I ordered many products recently due to having a wedding and a two-day concert happening within a few weeks of each other. I find actually going out shopping quite stressful, therefore I purchase things online, try them on and send them back if I don’t like them or they are no good. I have never had issues with this until recently with ASOSI made a few purchases recently at ASOS, Boohoo, Misguided and New Look for recent events. ASOS offer payment through Klarna , which is amazing due to being able to try clothes on and pay for the ones you like within 28 days, therefore saves paying off your card and waiting for a refund if not liked. Due to events fast approaching and not finding an outfit I liked, I decided to make a large order with ASOS to try on things which I hadn’t thought of previously. I also ordered things in both an 8 and a 10 due to sizes varying and having the size required if I finally found something I liked. Anyway, I ended up spending £399 and was sad to find that only a hat suited me out of the products I had purchased. I was fortunate enough to have liked items I had purchased from Boohoo on my card around the same time. I packaged my parcel up with everything barring the hat which I loved. I then attached the pre-printed labels and returned my parcel as I always do. I didn’t think anything of this until 19 days later I found on Klarna that I was still outstanding the full ASOS balance of £399. Shocked at this, I contacted ASOS who stated they hadn’t received my return.  They requested proof of sending. I initially thought I had sent this on the 28th May due to having a tracking system on my phone which showed that I stopped off at the post office on this date. I was able to locate a post office return receipt from the 24th May to ASOS following upturning my house and sent this in a proof of return. I was then informed that I said I previously informed them it was the 28th May I returned. I informed staff that I had sent many things back recently, therefore was mistaken and have proof that my ASOS parcel was returned on 24th May and was received by their depot.  I was informed that this would have to be passed onto the customer care team and would receive a reply within the next 24 hours. Almost 36 hours later I was sent and email from the customer care team to which completely shocked me. “After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for the return of order 410563118. It’s very rare for returns to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response”.So ASOS have apparently looked into my account and have suspected suspicious activity.  I have contacted various people from ASOS to which I have had people ignore me, put the phone down or basically make me feel like a criminal. Apparently, it is suspicious because I have made a few large purchases recently and sent most if not all of my order back due to not liking them. Having the option of Klarna, I have taken advantage of being able to make purchases and only pay for the ones I like and return the others without having to pay. Apparently, this is suspicious? Why I ask? Anyway, ASOS must think I still have my parcel despite informing them I don’t and have evidence of postage which confirmed they had received it. I am completely blocked from my ASOS account and will be unable to make any future orders (not that I would now) and have no way of discussing this case further with them.  I have made many orders with ASOS and have had no previous suspicious activity on my account. I have no criminal record. I have no bad reputation. I am a registered and respected mental health nurse working in the NHS. I have also never had any problems with any other shopping company. So it’s safe to say that I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the unprofessionalism and poor customer service that I have received from ASOS. I would be happy to remove my post should this be rectified by ASOS, however my opinion will always be negative of ASOS going forward should this not be resolved. I have also paid my £10 delivery saver and would like this refunding due to being unable to take advantage of this in the future.  #ASOS #Klarna #Delivery #Return #Refund #Refused #Disbelieved #Judged #NoExplanation #Blocked #BlockedAccount #Notabletocontact #Sterotyping #Misjudged #PoorCustomerService

            I always shop from this company & advertise it to everyone, cause I love their clothings. I live in Canada & sometimes I have to pay extra money for the tax & returning the item back to UK & it is stupidly expensive. Long story short, I have received one order & it was damaged. I did contact the support team, they advised me to return the item &  the shipment receipt .  They got the damaged jean back & I had to pay C$70.11 for the Canada post + C$42.08 jean from my pocket!!!  I am very Upset!!!!!!

            This companys delivery service chucked my parcels out in the soaking wet weather and mud and after I contacted them about it all they said was 'sorry' and refused to pass on my complaint to a manager. You'd think they would attempt to do something to compensate after that experience but they're so cheap they'd rather tell everyone the same fake sorry and go back to doing the same crap. Won't be buying from this crappy place again for sure

            I recently ordered and returned clothes a few days after receiving them. It has been over a month and i have yet to receive my refund ot get a clear answer as to why i haven't received it. The worst customer service i have ever had. If you look closely at their website they do not give you a phone number to call for issues. I have went back and forth only on emails and live chats to no help  AT ALL! They do not care if you have any issues, unprofessional and not to mention their clothes are horrible quality. Do yourself a favor just order from anywhere else!

            Returned two orders in one bag to save on packaging, posting etc. Admittedly (and in hindsight very mistakenly) from two different accounts - my one and my friend's one when she had to order something for me last minute and had Premier Next Day delivery to help me out. Put both returns slips in the package and posted back -  received a refund from one order but haven't for the other.Online chat was useless as the woman wrote that she ""can't help me with getting my money back and can't advise me any further"" just because I had returned orders from two accounts in one bag??Didn't even try asking what the other order number or postal tracking number was! Unwilling to look into it further, unwilling to refund me for my return and unwilling to send the item back to me since I've paid for it at the end of the day! So annoyed at this lack of customer care.

            Someone signed for me and clearly the hermes driver sent it to the wrong address. Now asos expects me to knock on the doors of all the neighbours in the street before they will take further action wth? Maybe don't use a useless courier like hermes. Past deliveries from asos have been with dpd which I've never had a problem with.

I haven’t even received a shipping confirmation email yet.I have been in contact with them trough chat and they just tell me to wait (at first until 15th and now until 20th of June).I can’t get real answers, just copy & paste responses and I had to ask them 6 times before they told me my package hasn’t even been shipped yet (at first they tried to hide it by telling me to check if it has been delivered to my neighbors and that there are delays in the shipping) I have also emailed them and sent them a message on Facebook but they have ignored it

            Bought a Paperdolls dress and a clutch handbag for a wedding. Was supposedly shipped on the 9th May to be delivered in Canada on the 31st. I had it shipped at the local post office since there have been reports of parcel thefts in our new neighborhood's FB page; it's the safest delivery option since it's it's a government instance.  I contacted them during the first week of June to ask for explaination, since there is no middle man for the delivery to my door (it basically leaves their warehouse, transits, go through custom, and transits to the post office; I have to go pick it up myself). Their customer service said ""we have to wait until the end of June"". I explained about the wedding and said I had no guarantee that they would still be available had I to buy another one; asked a few questions which all were answered without much useful information.  At the end, I was told ""can you go ahead and close this chat window so the conversation can be ended"". Wow. What a nice way to end contact. It's now the 17th of June and customs never take that long. So I guess, I will have to dash more money to get another dress as 1- I doubt there are anymore available on their website by now 2- I wouldn't take the chance to purchase it from there anymore and it's a bugger as I can't seem to find Paperdolls dresses anywhere else 3- according to other reviews, I won't be getting a refund anytime soon (they probably won't send me the merchandise again if it is still available). ""To hell the wedding you have to attend end"", that's how much they care. I am about to contact them again, not expecting much but oh yeah I will put up a fight. Sadly, no Paperdolls dress, no compensation for the trouble. I wished there was an internet police to investigate and hold companies like this accountable.

            You have to retype your email address each time you place an order. If you make an error (e.g hitmail ) by mistake, your order won’t appear on your account and you won’t get an email. They then try to blame this on something going wrong with the transaction. It takes constant emails / messaging / chats before finally after 5 days they can tell you what actually happened. Then even though by this time you have gone off the boil and probably shopped elsewhere instead, it’s tough because its too late to cancel apparently! Then you make complaint about the customer service you’ve received only to be told “ we don’t have a complaints department as we are all equally trained “ followed by “ if you have any questions please let me know”. Who ever trains these guys clearly has no knowledge on Customer Service.

            My girlfriend ordered two dresses from the site. Two weeks later she received an email stating they had had a technical glitch and the order had been cancelled. The money was charged, however. After making contact with the company, and speaking with Richard from ASOS, a refund on one of the dresses was made after much trouble, but the other was sent.When the dress arrived it did not fit, so a return label was ordered and the package was shipped the same day. Now almost three weeks after, still no refund of the second dress, they refuse to chat and require e-mails to be sent to them validating identity, despite doing so, it's still not sufficient, so we still chat (since they have no phones apparently) with ASOS, or that might too much to say, since they reject chatting and continue closing the chat whenever we refer to older chats and reference and order numbers and request a refund for the second dress...Chatting with two people named Jessie and Ellie were outright rude and not willing to do any type of customer care/service.I seriously don't comprehend how a company can exist with employees like that.

No wonder why you're rated 1 starContacted a customer service agent at asos called Rajintha and he/she was outright rude, all he kept saying was you will have to wait until midnight for your delivery even tho I paid 5.95 for next day and a specific time slot! I'm not waiting up until midnight for a delivery I have work early. Shocking service and rude! Also said that I wont get a refund for the delivery service I Paid for! I will be getting a refund as I didn't get the service I PAID for!*UPDATE*Been in contact with DPD and they say Asos didn't even send the parcel to them for shipping!

I recently bought a multipack of clothes from ASOS, after them being too large I sent them back and re-ordered the size smaller (XS) now unless you are 6ft or more, I wouldn’t bother ordering anything from their own brand. I’m 5’7 and the first set of T-shirts ordered in size S reached my knees. The second set ordered in XS reach the middle of my thighs. These are not long line, they’re just basic T-shirts. The model is 6’6 wearing a medium and its long on him. Ridiculous sizing.

            A distinctive feature of Asos is a huge number of product lines and a huge mass of information under each product. Strict rule - under each product is indicated the growth of the model, the size of the thing on it, and besides the photo, you can watch the video! This is really great because the photos don`t always show the material, fitting, and the model of the thing. In addition, under each product, there is a dimensional table of a specific brand and specific things. Choosing on them, the chance to settle with the size will be minimal. The main thing is not to forget that you need to look at these tables! You can also enter your parameters and the site will automatically calculate the desired size according to the table.

            Ordered a dress costing me $90 on sale and had a delivery date of June 3. Package was shipped may 13 to Canada with no tracking apparently. I’ve contacted them 18 times. I keep getting a scripted reply from each associate that I need to check with my neighbours and call my local post office to see if it is there.I called Canada post they literally told me without a tracking number they can do nothing. I contacted them back and they told me if it does not arrive by June 23 to get back to them. Told me they are an online company and no managers to speak to. I asked for someone to call me and they refused. At this point I am thinking my dress is not coming and going to be contacting my credit card company in hopes of a refund. I will never and I mean never order from this company again. I’m not sure what’s happened but I’ve ordered about two years ago and never had an issue. ASOS you really need to get your crap together because seriously customers is what will keep you in business. This is the worst customer service I have experienced in my entire life.

I got in touch with CC to cancel my order because I wanted to purchase Premium delivery and re book my order with no delivery fees. I wasn't able to cancel my order and was told I had to pay the delivery fees even if I wanted to purchase the Premium delivery. Spent 35 min on chat with CC to be told nothing could be done and no credit could be provided...... felt really stuck in the process and very disappointed by the experience with CC.

            Takes an eternity for refunds to be processed even though you can track that the company have received the goods back. Current offerings is 10 working days for refund ... even if you can see via tracking that they’ve had the goods for about a week!Last 3 occasions I’ve waited 10 days then raised the question ‘ where is my money’ .. I’m then told it’s been escalated to a specialist and then miraculously about an hr later I receive a paypal advise that the money has been refunded. What’s all that about.Sitting on customers money waiting for them to claim it is not how it works! Whether is a low value  order or not and the customer has followed your process and used the return methods offered within the timescales given then why do ASOS seem to disregard all their timescales and do what they want!

            If you want to place an order with ASOS you better hope you don’t have any problems, their customer service is abysmal and they genuinely don’t care. Had a gift card due to expire so used it to purchase an item which I ended up returning for a smaller size. The smaller size was still out of proportion and of poor quality so returned it for a refund. The gift card was added back to my account but have only just found out it expired only 2 weeks later??

            Terrible service. My order was expected to be delivered on the 5th of June and it still has not arrived. I have contacted ASOS 3 times trying to locate it (via email and live chat) and they have no idea where it is. I went out my way to contact the courier service who say they don’t know where the parcel is located in their depot and since my location isn’t high priority (rural Scotland) they will get in touch in a couple of days when they locate it. I have now moved address and I dread trying to organise the order to be redelivered as I already know this is going to be an issue for them. This order was over £130’s and I am left here not knowing when or if I will even receive it.

            Paid for express shipping for an item to ensure I received it before I left on an overseas trip. It was already late by the day I was going overseas so I contacted their ""customer service"" team to try and organise a return or cancel the delivery as I wouldn't be home within their return period. First person was difficult to deal with so I asked him to transfer me to someone else, which he refused saying ""you will get the same answer from them"". He then cancelled the chat while I was still talking, so I tried again and placed a complaint, second person was slightly more reasonable, but due to ASOS' stupid customer service policy she was useless too. After sending in a complaint, I received an email from customer service (not even manager) saying that they stand by the first persons decision to not transfer me. I don't give a duck if they tell me the same thing, I should be able to speak to another person if the person I'm talking to is dealing with the situation unsatisfactorily without being obstructed. After years of buying from ASOS, I will be boycotting them.

            Still waiting for them to confirm a return even though had confirmation that this was successfully delivered on Tuesday 11/06/2019.The reason i had to return the items in the first place was because the parcel arrived 2 days late after paying next day delivery and had to go and buy all the stuff again as it was needed for a christening ! I have had to pay out double and now need that money back to see me through the rest of the month.Last time i made a big return of stuff it went missing and it took weeks and weeks of emails for them to refund MY money !The customer service is shocking i now have to wait 5 days to find out that my return has indeed gone missing and then will have to spend my time trying to get money back that belongs to me !!I am a very loyal customer and have spent thousands with asos they really have gone to pot !

            I have shopped with ASOS for many years and have loved it. I loved it so much I purchased ASOS Premiere Delivery.  This was fine until the last couple of orders.  I found that I was no longer able to select next day free delivery despite my account details indicating that this was still active on my account.  I contacted ASOS on numerous occasions and eventually, I was advised that the 'Technical Team' had looked into my account and had decided to deactivate my Premiere Delivery.  They did refund the full purchase amount but this is not what I wanted.  I wanted to be able to use my Premiere Delivery.  I asked for an explanation but might as well have been talking to myself.  I did not get an explanation, only an invitation to re-purchase Premiere Delivery.  I don't think so!  I have now written to ASOS and requested that my account be closed.  I will not be buying from this company in future which is a shame because I have always loved doing so.  This company appears to have changed completely over the years I have been buying from them.  I may not be their intended target group but there was always something for everyone.  I am at an age where I have money to spend so more fool them.

            It should be referred to trade descriptions as they should not be allowed to call themselves Customer Care. We ended up paying twice for 1 order as they told us to reorder and they would credit.

            I order a lot from ASOS so I have paid for free next day delivery for a year (£9.95) twice now. Every order I have placed arrives the next day even when the ordered has been placed the evening before! I’m not usually in so I ask to have my parcels left in a safe place or with a neighbour and they always are! It’s usually the same driver as well so he knows where to leave it and always puts a card through the door (with a smiley face!) to let me know! The tracking is useful and returns are free and easy! Have only had a couple issues with a few orders but other than that the service is amazing! Thanks Asos!:)

My first order with Asos as i don't really like much of what they sell however found some really nice Kurt Geiger tassle loafers which i thought would be good for my holiday.I placed the order for this ONE item, mens loafers, with next working day delivery and what arrived was a bag, no box, with some type of footwear inside. After opening the bag i found glittery womans sandals inside, ridiculous.I contacted ASOS via Facebook messenger after waiting 30 minutes on their live chat with no response. I did initially receive a personalised response asking for my name and email, I requested the correct shoes be resent next working day as i needed them for my holiday and received a generic repose asking em to return the shoes and to pay for the delivery of the return myself. The abolsute worst service i have had in years and i order form many, many online retailers, these lot are cowboys and you can find all of their branded products elsewhere.

            I've now experienced the worst customer service of all time from this awful company. They don't give a **** about you as a customer. They don't answer emails, they refuse to take responsibility and try to hand you over to someone else and so on.I placed an order last Saturday, with a worth of almost 500£. It was urgent for me (my girlfriend) to get it delivered fast since she really needed some of the items in the order on a banquette the following Wednesday. So, they had at least 3 working days to deliver. To really make sure we would get it in time, I bought an extra service that would guarantee delivery the next working day - in this case, the Monday. Now its Thursday and I still haven't received the package. And I don't know at all when I can expect it since I'm given no information at all.  That's not the worst part.  The customer service and the way they handle this situation is. Go spend your money somewhere else, is my advise..

When I got the dress it smelled like someone had worn it for a while and then returned it. I immediately shipped it back but was only given a partial refund. I contacted customer service through an online chat to tell them about what had happened but was asked if I had taken any pictures. I don’t know how you would be able to take pictures of that lol. The person I talked to regarding this was Janine and not only did the process take 24 minutes (she took a long time to respond) but she was also rude. I do most of my shopping online and I have never dealt with customer service this horrible. Do not purchase anything from this store, not only do they cheat their customers but they also don’t value them.

My order was placed on the 25th of May and was supposed to arrive on the 1st of June. However, it never arrived. It seems that Asos didn't even ship the package. Now, more than two weeks later, the package is still not shipped. I've tried contacting the customer service several times, but they fail to provide me with a proper response. Instead, I receive standard answers and contradictory messages. Plus, they take more than a week to reply. The customer service is truly a joke. Absolutely horrible.

            Clothes from Asos are great, not the problem. However there customer service is ridiculous. I’ve waited over a week for my order, due date is today and I received the tracking information. To then find out my parcel has been sent back to them within the hour of them sending it... due to a damaged package. I doubt that very much. I emailed them to resolve my problem. They told me to reorder the items, although one of the two items is out of stock. They didn’t care, I asked for a discount/ free delivery because this was a hassle for me. Again no help, the lady said to me, if you look on Facebook you’ll find one there. And I have to wait 7 days for a refund from a package I never received.  I don’t think so.

            Beware of ASOS Refund Rip off if using a discount code..I purchased two dresses the same but different sizes, each dress was £90.00 non discounted and £75.00 with a discount code.If I had purchased one dress the cost would also have been £75.00But if you return an item ASOS take all the discount off the returned item so you get a refund of the amount paid minus ALLl the discount and you are expected to pay the FULL non discounted price on the item you kept.  Best thing to do is order both items separately if you are expecting to return an item, or better still order else where.

Not only did 6 items from my order not arrive, but after over 2 weeks of communicating with the asos team via facebook, they still have not given me a refund. They respond with a robotised answer of ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and ""We've been busier than usual"" FOR 2.WEEKS. STRAIGHT.

            For 8 years I have been a very good and very loyal Asos' customer: in fact, pretty everything I was buying was coming from their website. Troubles were rare and I had full satisfaction about this e-seller that I was using on a really regular basis (often monthly) and that I was recommending to everyone around me.However, these last years Asos' quality has started to lower and lower on several levels: first on quality products, then on prices and promotion codes (which don't even exist anymore), on deliveries efficiency and finally, on customer service effectiveness. This is the first time of my life that I write an online review.My last order was a huge joke. Not only it arrived super late (2 weeks after ordering), not only they didn't warn me about this delay, not only they didn't inform about 2 products being out of stock and going to miss in the parcel, not only they took my money way before shipment (including the cost of the 2 missing items),  but their customer service happened to be a complete nonsense, totally disrespectful as well as useless: 2 ways of reaching them: 1- Email (nobody answers) 2- Tchat' (automatic-bot agents unable to help who'll close the window if you're not okay with their absurd answers). I am very disappointed. This is not just about orders being ""less"" satisfying but being really awful, a big waste of time, money and nerves, when we exactly use e-shop to save time, money and nerve... After around 5 tchat's and 4 emails trying to fix it, I'm still waiting for the rest of my products, my due refund, not speaking about a fair compensation. I'm done. This was my very last Asos order and I hope that all customers will find various ways to express their genuine discontent.This is not a way to treat people you take money from, people you call ""clients"".

            This site doesn’t even deserve 1 star! The customer policy is extremely bad! I’ve been ordering items on ASOS since some years ago. But roughly one year ago something has changed and every single order I was buying came wrong to me. Twice I’ve been getting absolutely wrong sizes, simply it wasn’t the size I’ve ordered. Once I’ve ordered 38 sized leggings, ASOS sent me 34!!! Then I’ve ordered T-shirt for my boyfriend in size L, they’ve sent me M. The final and worst case is I’ve ordered puma sandals for kinda big price and the item I’ve got was absolutely different, DIDNT MATCH the description at all and costed 1/3 less on other websites. I’ve been trying to get partial refund, but the only thing ASOS did was telling me this is not stated in their policy. Bye, ASOS. I do not recommend this to anyone! Never shop with ASOS, guys!

            Usually, I love Asos, but their customer service is so bad!!! I ordered two pair of jeans 3 weeks ago. It was supposed to arrive at the 3rd of June, but it did not. Then I emailed Asos, where their response was ""Wait until the 9th"". on the 9th I emailed them again saying my parcel had still not arrived. Now they want me to wait until the 17th... And the worst part is that they only send me those automatic answers... I keep saying I just want to know where my jeans are, but they just want me to wait another week...

            My partner has been a loyal customer of ASOS for years. Up until now, everything was okay. In the last order, he received a completely different item. This might happen. There was a return label so we have returned the item. There has been no reaction, no refund, no e-mail for about a month.We have sent several e-mail to the customer service, we have never got any response. We have tried the chat several times. After having waited for an hour, we finally could talk to someone. We always got the same copy-paste response. I have never been this furious. Having googled the CEO's e-mail address, I have sent a complaint.Guess what? The mail has been transferred to the customer service and I got, once again, a copy-paste response that didn't answer my question at all. Shame on you, ASOS. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered.I'd rather shred my money or burn it than buy anything from you ever again.

            WHERE IS ASOS’S CUSTOMER SERVICE....................I have been a loyal customer with ASOS for years, as they have lovely clothes and great prices.HOWEVER, on the one and only time I have had the unfortunate displeasure in contacting ASOS, due to an order that had suddenly midway in delivery been returned to ASOS, without the delivery company attempting delivery, with no explanation, and I had to contact both ASOS chat and email them to find out why. Unfortunately, I was met with un apologetic, in-personable and generic scripted responses, stating sorry  if my order/parcel was being sent back to ASOS , it could be due to being damaged or no one being in, and a full refund would occur in 5-10 days once they had received the parcel, and THEY could not resend the items ordered due to SECURITY REASONS. If I wanted to order again, as I had commented I had to wait for a refund, to use Klarna .......So they offered no help to contact the delivery company to establish why my order was being returned just a blunt unhelpful statement that  the parcel was being returned  for some unknown reason, and once they have received it they would then  process it, and I would receive a refund in 5-10 days........  ASOS CUSTOMER SERVICES , WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.3 days later I receive a bashed up parcel which was sloppily taped in the delivery companies tape, and box open and damaged, containing a partial order with no invoice.I then had to contact ASOS email again to find out why I have received a partial order in a bashed up and ripped open box, when on 2 occasions ASOS customer services told me that it was being returned to them, not aware of why, and I would be receiving a full refund, and they would be unable to resend my original order out.Yet again I was met with lack lustre generic email and apology, with a refund for the item that was missing, but no explanation  why I’ve received a partial order in a damaged delivery box when THEY stated I wouldn’t be receiving the items.After several emails with generic responses of ASOS customer services taking no responsibility, and implying it was the delivery companies fault and not answering my questions on why my order and delivery was such a shambles, where at one moment I wasn’t receiving it I would be getting a refund, to 3 days later receiving a partial order in a bashed and damaged box, and myself informing them of this and that a item was missing with no explanation or acknowledgement of the stress and frustration of myself having to chase the status of the order over 6-7 emails in total, over 4 days in total. ASOS took no responsibility, none whatsoever, and no personable sincere apology was received apart from there generic responses. Other online companies have bent over backwards when there has been a problem with one of my deliveries, they have contacted and kept me informed of the situation after I initially contacted them, and I’ve felt like a person and valued customer, and I’ve been offered sincere apologies and vouchers for the inconvenience.UNFORTUNATELY NOT WITH ASOS, THEY OFFER GENERIC SCRIPTED RESPONSES, ACKNOWLEDGING NO RESPONSIBILITY OR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER HAS TO DO ALL THE CHASING, WITH NO SINCERE APOLOGY OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS.ASOS YOU NEED TO REVIEW YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICY AND RHETORIC, AS YOU HAVE NONE. THIS CAN ALSO BE MIRRORED BY OTHER CUSTOMERS REVIEWS ALSO. ASOS. You need to treat your so called valued customers as VALUED......

            I have been shopping with ASOS for years, I really like their clothes and I've never had a problem with them up until a week ago. I have had Premier Delivery for about 3 years and always renew it in March when it expires. This year was no different. A few Sundays ago I went to buy an outfit for the following Saturday. I saw that Next Day Delivery wasn't an option for me and Premier Delivery wasn't showing on my Account. I emailed ASOS and it took 2 days to get a reply back to tell me to clear my cookies which should fix the problem. That obviously wasn't the issue as it was happening on their iOS app but I did it anyway and tried again but to no avail. I responding to the agent with screenshots of the order when I bought it and they told me that they were transferring me to another team to investigate. It's now been over a week and I've heard nothing from them. I am appalled that a company like ASOS would treat it's customers so badly. I really like shopping with them so I hope they resolve this issue soon and improve their Customer Service experience.

Placed an order with them and didn't realise that a discount code would mean if i return anything, i wouldn't receive the full cost back.

            Loyal ASOS customer for years, not had may problems really until it comes down to needing to talk to someone. Once their delivery driver allegedly attempted delivery 3 times however left no card or a blank card so I was unable to rearrange delivery for a suitable time. After getting nowhere with online chat, the order got returned to the warehouse even though I needed it, and I had to reorder. Waste of both of our time! Now, I have 2 orders, standard delivery. When I checked why they haven't arrived, website is telling me it will take 10 days because they are busy! Not acceptable. It did not say this when I ordered. I even purchased the premier delivery with the second order and got free delivery (which has to be over £25 to qualify) however the order only amounted to £21.95. So I'm struggling to understand why it has been processed with standard delivery for free, rather than the premier that I purchased!! Tried online chat again (for some reason!) and was met with a completely snooty and blunt advisor who did nothing for me, other than tell me the order will arrive in 10 days and I don't have the option to cancel. Then asked what else they can do to help?! I said you haven't helped me at all so far.. then they ended the chat!! Laughable! AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOWHERE TO COMPLAIN PROPERLY.They are definitely going down hill. On the plus side, if you need a job that requires zero skills whatsoever (or a brain!) and pays you to do absolutely nothing of value - ASOS online customer service could be right up your street!

            I love ASOS's clothes, but their customer service is ABYSMAL. I was on two online chats with two different representatives for an HOUR, an got absolutely nowhere. I had purchased one-year Premier Shipping for $15, and when I purchased my clothing order, it said ""Premier Shipping Active"" in the checkout. When I received any order confirmation however, the delivery date was with standard delivery. I reached out to ASOS through chat (because, annoyingly, they do not have a phone number) and received absolutely no help at all. I waited up to TWENTY MINUTES for a response at times, and at other times the customer service agent literally answered a question of mine by copying and pasting a line from the ASOS website. The rep said that he was ""transferring my query to a team of specialists""---aka passing the baton and trying to get rid of me--and could not give me any timeframe as to when they would contact me. When I became frustrated, the customer service rep ENDED THE CHAT. Completely unacceptable customer service. I spend a lot of money on their website, and I expected better than this; they treated me like an annoyance, and didn't help solve my problem due to their horrible customer service.

            1. I placed an order and paid with PayPal.2. PayPal sent confirmation of my order.  ASOS did not.3. 1st support representative with whom I chatted (literally - as there is no phone support) told me that I did not receive a conformation email because the order did not truly go through.  There was a breakdown in order transmission from PayPal to ASOS and I guess I was to believe that my order had been cancelled...?4.  I was on the fence about size, so I ordered a different size of the same item from a different site.5.  Lo and Behold!  I received the item I ordered from ASOS.  I also received the item from the other vendor.  Order from Other Vendor fits.  Item ordered from ASOS does not.Now, that I've prefaced the situation.....I need to return the item ordered from ASOS.  Two things are required to make a return.a) an order #b) a Returns Note (aka a packing slip, a reason for the return, etc.)c) a shipping labelRegarding the 1st:  I was to have gotten ""a)"" when I placed the order.  (It took chatting with a 2nd support rep for :15 to determine that I had miskeyed my email address.  But she could not change it, resend the confirmation email, or even TELL me what my order # was)Regarding the 2nd and the 3rd:  Both items were to have been included in my received order.  Neither of them were.SHORTER VERSION:  I have spent 60 minutes chatting with 3 different representatives and can not get what I need to make a return.  I give up.  All I can do now is learn from the experience and NEVER ORDER FROM ASOS AGAIN.

            I've been ordering from Asos for years, but over the past year their service has got worse and worse. Delivery times are awful and they've stopped sending me emails as to WHEN my package will arrive.The clothes i've order have mostly been poor quality and different to what they look like on the website. The lengths and sizes are wrong (skirts/trousers have all been longer than mentioned) and the fabric is different to the photos, or they're just awful photos that don't show the textures on the fabric.Colours are also often different as well, or patterns look very different. Returns take longer than they say they should, even after Asos receive the order. Overall a very bad service, wouldn't recommend.

            Absolutely disgusting customer service, the last 3 orders have been nothing but a nightmare. I have the premier delivery next day delivery, 3 days it took for me to receive one order. No apology when I contacted them, then they sent a faulty item which was sent straight back and I have to chase a refund. I had to use the resolve website and they finally contacted me , still no apology but after another load of emails got my refund . Then came the another dispute because an order I made was 20% off, when I sent back a bag on that order they took back the 20% discount off the whole order , fuming I asked them to send back the bag as I would rather keep the bag than miss out on my discount I was told I couldn’t have the bag back, scam artists BEWARE never will I use this company again, the incompetence of the customer service advisors is terrible, you can use the money you stole from me and others to pay for their training!!!! 😡

            #asos uk  I  recently ordered a new top from ASOS, when i open the packaging this smelt very strongly of a woman's perfume and sweat! (disgusting). The label was loosely attached and due to the strong smell, I felt as if the top had been worn, and not just tried on. I did love the top, but they had run out of my size. I contacted customer services as I thought that a discount was warranted, because the top seemed to have been worn and smelt badly. I didnt think that it was fair to pay full price, but ASOS offered absolutely nothing. Firstly, I question how thoroughly they check returns, this top really stank. Secondly, the customer service offered by this company is abysmal.They kept telling me they were doing all they could, which turned out to be nothing.

They are using dodgy companies, they dont leave calling cards,they dont attempte to deliver and on tracking you get attempted or no access and they are sending back the goods.now days other companies you track drivers,you get a text,delivery window,you can leave instructions to drivers but asos can not be bothered, the app is a joke while you having conversation on the chat box with customer services you get rude,condescending messages and cut you off and close the chat.Will not use this company again,told family and friends to be wary there clothes might not turn up,if it does quality is bad shoved in a plastic bag.

First they sent me the wrong dress, then they claim they didn't receive it back and wouldn't refund me cause I don't have a proof of return, I dropped it off in a ups box. I ordered the dress again as it was for a wedding and received a broken zipper. Then paid for expedited shipping and it still arrived 2 days late. No number to call and speak with someone.

I have a screenshot of that, I wish I can upload it and show to the whole world how ASOS treats their customers. I sent item back on my cost, never heard from them again.Opened PayPal dispute, never answered, had to escalate to Paypal to get my money back. Asos if you are reading this, I will never buy from you again. Never.  I will tell everyone I know not to buy from you. You just lost a customer, a customer who will spread a world ""how great your company is"". And if you think you are only one retail available online  - you're wrong. You will get it, soon. I hope really soon.PS. They offered me a laughable $10 bucks, while the item cost was $15 and I shipped it back on my cost which was $13. Jesus Christ.  I will make sure to leave an one star review everywhere I know.

            Zero ratings. I have been a loyal happy customer for many years until now. ASOS have massively messed up changing courier to DHL they are so incompetent. Ordered next day delivery to be told it was delayed by 2 days. Then 3 then 4. DHL declined my offer to collect and added 2 extra days making my order now 6 days late. Numerous chat and emails and ASOS declined a replacement order even though their courier had their goods they insisted it still had to be investigated. They finally told DHL to return parcel to them and informed me I had 7 days to wait for its return then up to 10 days for a refund. Awful customer service and will have retained my money and goods for 23 days and seem to think that’s a great help. Deserve to go into administration

            My rating is related to the company that Asos partners up to deliver their packages here in NL. I think the issue is more in the shoulders of the company (PDP) but since Asos partners w them, I think it is only fair to share the blame. PDP has sent me bunch of delivery emails for my recent order w Asos, only to attempt to deliver at completely different date and time slot. Thankfully as I was keeping an eye on the delivery via track and trace, I was able to suggest change to deliver the order to a pick up location instead. They accepted this suggestion. I have left work early to pick up my parcel at this pick up location, only to get a message ( as I arrived) that they changed the delivery location to another location. Which was closing as I was receiving that message. I feel that the shipment market is absolutely in a need of innovation and some regulation as this is insane. They behave as if nothing mattered to them. We as customers have no say, nothing ever changes based on our feedback, because they are a necessary evil with low competition. Just so frustrating! Wish Asos offered variety of delivery companies options so that I did not have to repeatedly deal with DPD service.

            Scam: Beware they may simply 'lose' your package - and you won't get a refund. They can't tell you where it is. Nor will they help you locate it. You can't talk to customer service. There's a team of poorly trained UK people on Messenger, who aren't allowed to do anything but push out pre-written variations over the theme 'f*** you, customer'. For all intents and purposes, this is a scam.

            I made an order of 4-5 items which ended up being over 100 pound. Amazing! I am applicable for 20% off. Not quite, one of the shirts was too big, not trusting ASOS' exchange would be here in time before I went on holiday I ordered the medium instead on the same day hours after trying on the original shirt. The shirt was originally 25 pound so 20 pound after applying the discount, I really wanted the shirt so accepted I would have to pay full price for the correct size one. Later on holiday I received an email saying I had been refunded.... wait for it.... 1.80, yes 1.80 for a 25 pound shirt. I was expecting 20 pound as any normal human with a half working brain would. So I went to the livechat (waiting forever I should add), explained the situation, *keep in mind I had bought the exact same shirt and given them more money on the day of receiving my order* and was told because the refund took me under the 100 pound I wasn't entitled to the discount. At this point I looked at the screen and thought 'you must be joking'. Any normal company could see I bought the same shirt and would at least give me 20 pound if not maybe more for the hassle, NOT ASOS! I was told I could of exchanged the shirt and then this wouldn't of been the case, even though I have essentially done that myself whilst giving them more money and explained an exchange would take too long. I personally asked the person on the chat how she would feel in my position, ""I'm not aloud to give my opinion"", thank you for that you have made me feel like this is personal experience and I'm not talking to a robot (obvious sarcasm).Eventually she suggested I should refund the new shirt that fits me hence why I bought it, I said the tags were off and she said I therefore couldn't refund it. These were her only two solutions? Finally she had the nerve to copy and paste the refund policy to which she had already told me I wasn't entitled too and left the chat herself whilst I was typing, lovely experience isn't it? The company have essentially stolen my money at this stage, 1.80 for a shirt, if I took both receipts in to any shop they would sort it out there and then. This experience was baffling and quite frankly a disgusting way to treat a customer that has made multiple and frequent orders from them.Advice: DO NOT SHOP HERE even with  90% discount, customer service is the lowest I've seen in my 23 years alive.

In the past few months I have had the wrong items delivered, paid for next day deliveries not sent out four days past the delivery date and now the latest I've been told  after calling everyday for a week by head office I have to wait an additional month for an item to be delivered due to a change of internal procedure!  and to add insult to injury the order can not be cancelled.

Its fine, they always get me wrong sizes. I knew I can do the refund, however the item i want to order is out of stock now, mean that I cannot get what I want and been waiting for 10days got NTH. So I contacted the CS, after sending them pics telling the story. They just leave me a official standard answer. return the goods and I will get the refund. So then I explained to them that if I refund ( normally I never do so, ASOS always get me wrong sizes,)  I will suffered from the loses of exchange rate from the banks ---- HK Dollars against GBP. and they just dont give a shxt and asked to do the refund.......i am so disappointed, I wasted time to contact them and wasted to wait for the delivery, and finally i got nothing but also a lose of finance charges from the bank.

As a customer I shouldn't have to coach them into apologising or trying to resolve the issue, even worse I shouldn't have to suggest ways in which they might try to resolve a problem, even if they won't. If all these staff are trained to do is copy and paste policies from the website they are a wasted resource and money. Appalling when you consider the customer base and turnover. Feel free to listen to my call recording, id hope someone with some common sense would to try and one day improve this shambolic excuse for customer service.

            Update : received correct refund but only after I had to ring few times . I would still urge people to check refunds carefully Warning !! Check any refunds from ASOS !!I am a loyal customer of Asos and order regularly. I ordered almost £400 worth of stuff last month as they were running a special 25% for students. It is the company’s policy not to give discount on items already for sale which is fair enough . I returned an item and found that Asos had taken 25% off my refund ! It was never 25% off as it was already on sale !I have been trying to get help on live chat , twitter and email  with no joy This could be happening to other customers so make sure you check what they refund you Is correct I hope that it was honest mistake! Really has left a bad taste in mouth and put me off ordering from them again particularly since you cannot get assistance from customer service.

First it said it is going to be here on 23th of May, then on 3rd of June, then on 6th of June,  then it said 17th of june. Seeing them prolong delivery time has been stressfull, but dresses have arrived today (5th of June). So its great, cause my ocassion that I bought them for is tomorow. I contacted customer service via live chat on Web site, they were nice but they said they cannot do anything, maybe they did. Dresses are great, I like the quality, they are Asos brand. Only thing is that, I bought size 38 expecting to alter dresses, and I even lost some weight and they are almost too small. So go size up if u are buying non lace dress.

            Absolutely terrible customer service. You are accountable if your package doesn't arrive. Paid for next day delivery, 5.95. The package doesn't arrive. They refuse to refund me the delivery cost because sometimes this can happen 'during busy times' In my opinion if you have someone pay for next day delviery and they don't deliver, you should refund them. They said ' this happens and its not our fault'. If the service is busy, they shouldnt have the option to pay more for delivery. Robbing you blind

            Terrible shopping experience. It’s an absolute nightmare to return anything- and with my last order two items were missing. Spent a week emailing there customer service daily. No answer. Finally got through on the chat where they informed me that the items were out of stock and that they had refunded the money and emailed me about it. I checked my email and my spam- completely untrue. The customer service agent was patronizing. Total time wasters.

            I can only presume Asos is being run by a different company now or something because recently the customer service is terrible. I have been a loyal customer since I moved to the UK. On 16th May I bought a jacket for my husbands birthday along with some other clothes, used a discount code. The jacket arrived and the sizing it said online was wrong so it was way too big. As the website said they had “limited stock” and I didn’t want to miss out on the smaller size I ordered another on the 17th and it arrived on the 18th. He tried it on and we returned the size that was too big. They received the return on 20th and I know as I have tracking. I waited until 29th and emailed as I had not had confirmation they had received it and the website states they email when they receive it. I then emailed again on the 3rd June and got a reply early hours this morning 5th saying I won’t be getting a refund because I used a discount code. Despite the fact I purchased the jacket already in a smaller size. I am extremely disappointed that they would treat someone like this as I have now bought/paid for two jackets, I only have one of them and they refuse to compensate me

            Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years, and have spent god knows how much money on ASOS. And yet, despite that, the moment I have a problem I am treated incredibly poorly. I have sent messages to them that have been completely ignored - both on email and facebook. I have had live chats where I have waited over 15 minutes for the team member to reply. I was told 6 days ago that a manager would be calling me within 24-48 hours, which of course they didnt. when I checked up on it 3 days later I was reassured again that they would call me as soon as possible. When I checked up again today I was told there is no such thing as customer managers, no one would be calling me. I had to call up once again to ask why I had been waiting for 6 days for a nonexistent manager, before being told I would be put on the list AGAIN for a manager to call me. I am so angry and exhausted.

            Useless doesn't even cover it. I purchased premier delivery membership in order that I receive what I order quickly. First order I place on Friday 31st night gets scheduled for delivery on Monday. Hardly next day delivery DPD inform me that my parcel will be deliver two days later. Then I hear nothing from ASOS but when checking tracking it says my parcel has been x-rayed and return to ASOS. I contact them at 10am and was given no explanation and told I'd have to wait up to 7 days for the parcel to be returned and a further 5 days before they process my refund. No apology either. They just tell me to place another order. They point blank refuse to refund immediately and refuse to let me speak to a manager to escalate a complaint. I get told that managers are not customer facing. What the hell that even means I don't know. I contact DPD  who advise me that it was returned to ASOS because they had not included an invoice. So it's ASOS's fault I never got my parcel but I have to wait two weeks till a refund is sent? DPD also tell me that ASOS received my parcel at 09.58, before i have even called them. So they have lied saying it's with the carrier as it's already been scanned by their system. Still they accept no responsibility nor offer an acceptable explanation and still I am £106 down

            Returned items (one of wish was faulty with a home in) on 23rd May. Now 4th June and not even a confirmation email to say my refund is being processed. I have checked proof of postage and the parcel was actually delivered on 24th May. Tried to speak to CS and they keep telling me I have to wait until tomorrow (7 working days after posting) to claim a refund and they will do it manually?! Why couldn’t someone just do it days ago as they have had the parcel for over a week now!!

            Absolutely useless. Fail to deliver on time - every single order I've been insane enough to make from them. I should have learned. Their customer service is about as bad as it can get and they really couldn't care less. Refuse to escalate to senior management and ""processes' that involve cutting your off from chat rather than solving the customer's complaints.I wouldn't usually have anything to do with them but needed a fancy dress outfit.They don't deserve a single customer the way they treat them

            I placed an order on 23rd May, and it's estimated time delivery was 31st May. I still haven't gotten an email saying that the order is shipped. Now they are saying my order will be with me until 7th June, which is hard to believe since it still hasn't been sent.  I contacted ASOS customer help multiple times, as always I got the most generic answers which were not helpful at all, plus probably the most rude customer support I've came across. No one knows where my order is or if it has been sent, but they know that it'll be with me by 7th June. I loved ASOS but having this happen to me and now seeing other reviews I think I'm never ordering from them again.

Was told Next Day delivery can take 4 working days which clearly isn’t Next Day. My items finally turned up Monday when Hermes could be bothered to deliver and too late for when items were needed for. Gave Asos another chance and now a parcel with dhl parcel which was supposed to be with me 10:37-11:37am hasn’t arrived it’s now 3:55pm they ignore their social media and you can’t talk on the phone, so leaving me in the dark to what’s happening and now I have to go out after waiting in all day. Apparently dhl knew at 12:10 that they had no intention of delivery and didn’t let me know till 7:10pm

I used it on a jacket but when I went to order the jacket became out of stock.  Fine I thought and ordered the next size up....but the code didn't work...it said it had been used.  No order had gone through.A simple fix I thought....PAH....nope.  I emailed their customer service as suggested through Facebook.  Still no reply by next day.  I tweeted them...honestly the bot on there was drunk.  I finally managed to get chat to work and the actual person I spoke to said they needed to pass on the info to someone else.  I  eventually got a reply saying that the code had been linked to another account.  I DONT HAVE ANOTHER ACCOUNT! Crazy! Awful.  I'll go to a shop and buy it myself as they are actually a joke.

            I have ordered so many times from Asos, and the delivery was prompt. The products always arrived by the date they had mentioned. This time something is really wrong. The items have not even left the warehouse. There is no tracking number, and on the courier site it shows that for 3 days they are scanning the items. :-(. Contacted costumer service yesterday and they just told me they are sorry and that my order should arrive by tomorrow (it is still in the warehouse). Do miracles happen? Asos should really think of changing their delivery company.EDIT: So I changed my first review from one to three stars, as my order actuallly arrived with one day delay. The problem was there was no email notification regarding the dispatch of the delivery and no tracking number.

            Absolute worst customer service. I ordered clothes for two events (one being my brothers wedding) and paid for two day shipping. They messed up and sent it standard. When I tried to get help and have them amend their mistake by canceling the order and resending it with the correct shipping, they said I could reorder it again and choose day shipping again, and basically hope it works out.

            Poor customer service, I pay for Premier Delivery to get next day delivery so when I place an order I get this automatically. They have now changed the default to 'standard delivery' which takes around a week. This seems a cynical way to save money as if you don't spot it you can't change it after the order. I also can't cancel the order even though it's a week away. Disappointing will now avoid.

I used THEIR included return label to ship my items back and they are now saying that they never received the package and that it was my responsibility to get a tracking ID. How does that make any sense? They included a return label, so they should have that information. I've never had an issue until this order but I will not be ordering from them again and I have disputed the charges through my bank. Hoping they help me out considering ASOS has done nothing to help the situation and the agent had a snarky attitude.

            Placed an order included a pair of shoes and 2 pairs of Jeans woth £150 altogether. Returned all 3 in the same bag however only got refunded the shoes as ASOS somehow lost the 2 Jeans and said it was my responsibility somehow and nothing they could do. So now i'm £50 out of pocket and with neither pair of jeans. Fantastic as always ASOS :)

            Did not price match item which was £10 & £15 cheaper elsewhere and when I completed the purchase at the full price because I thought they are a 'reliable' company, a few hours later they offered a discount of 20% on all items. Very poor experience. Legislation needs to be brought in where customers are given a 24 hour window of receiving the offer if they have made purchases shortly before.

            Their items are closely always out of stock, and I have more than once experienced that I ordered something and then got a mail several days after saying that the items can’t be sent because it’s out of stock.They provide no or close to no service or help in situations where costumer service is contacted.

            I used to be a regular customer at ASOS until recently. Slow response from the customer care department, missing parcels and frustrating long-winded conversations when contacting ASOS and trying to sort out refunds for missing parcels etc. They completely ignored my detailed email concerning a purchase. Really poor service and I will never use this site again.

            I love ASOS. I don't know why there are so many bad comments. Asos is the only place I shop for clothes because, it's so my style. So chic. The pricing of their products are understandable, plus you get 10% off as a student and free deliveries if you buy ASOS Premium. It's just a £10 for a year. No biggy. I've never had a bad experience for delivery either.

            Service has worsened significantly this year. Package arrived with 4 missing items; an e-mail informed me 3 days after they arrived that the missing items had gone out of stock. How do they even let someone order 4 items that aren’t even there?! And wait Over a week to inform them?! Customer service gives the same vague and unhelpful copy and paste answer each time I reach out. I’m constantly made to feel that they could not care less about their customers. The fact that I’ve been a very loyal customer for years, spending thousands, makes all of this even more infuriating. I hope they fix their issues soon

            I ordered three jumpers from ASOS with a 20% discount code but needed to exchange 2 of them for size as they were gifts and I got the sizes wrong. I spoke to someone on the live chat feature and was told that the best option would be to return and then order them again as there was a 20% code active on that day too. When I got the email confirming my return, I could see that they weren’t sending the full refund I was entitled to because the “refund” (even though I wanted an exchange and was advised to go through this route instead) meant that the total of my original order had dropped to £90 and the original 20% code was only for purchases over £100. The easiest option to resolve my issue was simply send me the extra money I am owed but instead, ASOS want me to return the original jumper and then order it again (there is another 20% offer today) which just seems ridiculous to me. I tried speaking to someone on live chat but this person called “Freddie” was extremely rude and closed the chat before I was even finished. I then called ASOS and this advisor (who actually had some customer service skill) said he would refer my case to the Escalations team and they would call me back today. Still awaiting this call but I don’t have a lot of hope and will probably have to go through the hassle of returning my original jumper, order the same one again (at delivery cost to ASOS) and essentially waste a whole load of time and effort on mine and ASOS part..

            I am an very avid customer of Asos and I have had one or two issues in the past with service but it was quickly resolved. However, I am very disappointed with a recent order. I did not receive an item within the order I received. I notified them of this and they came back within 24 hrs. They said they will resolve and apologised. However, If they ship today 31.05.19 they say i will not receive the item until Friday June 7th. I am away on that day for a trip and i have asked if they could ship it quicker for me.  They have said no. The funny thing is, if i make a purchase from their site today, i will have the items within 3/4 days, sooner to what i am being offerer, for their mistake. Why is this fair or acceptable? I spend a lot of money with them and now i am seriously discouraged from purchasing with them again. Poor customer service for a mistake I did not make.

            I have been a longstanding customer ordering over 5 times yearly and always vouched for the service and timeliness. HOWEVER this has changed... made an order on the 20th of May. I never received a dispatch email (like I usually do). One day prior to the delivery date (28th May) I spoke to customer care who asked me to wait until midnight of the said delivery date.. It was pretty obvious that the order was not going to arrive.. I have now been asked to wait until the 3rd June.. up until today (31st may) I have not received any dispatch email. I then stupidly went and re-ordered one of the items using the next day delivery service costing me 20euros extra because I needed the item for an occasion tomorrow (2nd june). Delivery date was meant to be 30th May.. Guess what? Today 31st May and the package has not arrived. The DHL tracking number provided is incorrect!! Absolutely appalled by the service!!!!!! ASOS please get your act together...

            *UPDATE NO. 2*Two weeks later, nothing's changed. As predicted, now they are telling me to wait until the end of 14th of June. This is actually against the law. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.*UPDATE*A week later, nothing's changed. Now they are telling me to allow until the end of 7th June (Friday of course, so they can buy themselves more time) because of any postal and/or shipping delays. On Monday the 10th, they'll tell me to allow until the end of 14th. I wonder how long will I have to do this. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.I've always been satisfied with their service, delivery and clothes that were provided. Turns out, that was only because I never encountered a problem. I placed an order on the 23rd of May. They promptly sent me an order confirmation, and took money out of my account the day after that. I never got a shipping confirmation, but since they stated the order will be here on the 31st, I didn't give it much thought. On the 30th of May, I spoke with their customer care (care as word here is used reaaaaally broadly), and basically they don't know anything, no connections to their warehouse, no knowledge about my order, it's like they don't even work for ASOS. All that they could do is, with obviously scripted words, „reassure“ me that my order is due on the 31st. Told me to wait, even though it seems ludicrous that the order will arrive on time, but fine, I can wait one more day. Well, Friday the 31st arrived and lo and behold, my order didn't arrive (which is obvious to everyone SINCE IT HADN'T SHIPPED). And now I get to repeat the whole process.Reached out to customer care again on the 31st, told me to get in touch on Monday, there's nothing they can do now. I am not dissatisfied just because of the order. I am completely dissatisfied with their treatment of the costumers and their absurdly incompetent way of training customer care employees. Obviously the people who work there aren't at fault here, they are just saying what they are told to, but it is so frustrating to even read what they type, it feels like I'm talking to a computer, but like the one from 1995. I don't want to be the 'you just lost a customer' person, but you definitely lost a customer.I'm giving it two stars only because the products are good quality, and I never had any problem until now.

            I have been a loyal customer with ASOS in many years. I still regularly  order from ASOS, but I think I have placed my last ever order with them.The customer ""care"" is perhaps the worst customer service I have ever been in touch with. No understanding and no wanting to fix the problems.My previous order from them was cancelled due to one item not being in stock - even though they were clearly available on the website. Not compensation or anything. Just a horribly arrogant customer care person.But my last order really made me reconsider every using ASOS again. They simply do not care - at all. I purchased a lot of clothes from them - and to make sure the order would get to me in time I payed for next day delivery. When I didn't get the order by evening on the promised date of delivery I contacted the customer support. But he wouldn't help me until the next day! He would not even look into the case until the following day! - he wouldn't even confirm whether my items was shipped or not. Today I contacted the customer service again. This time I was forwarded to another department which I was told would solve my problem. I have still have not heard anything from them - 12 hours later. Nothing..I used to recommend ASOS to everyone. Now I say - avoid at all cost!

            I'm not one to write reviews, but I've SO many bad experiences with ASOS deliveries now that I felt it was time I shared so new customers are aware of what to expect. The customer care team are probably amongst the worst I have ever dealt with. It's clear that ASOS do not care at all about their customers and the experience they have shopping with them. My last order turned up broken and I didn't get a new one for weeks because the customer care team sent the new one to the wrong address and then blamed me for incorrect details (despite this being a renewal request to the same address). Because of the mess up, I spent weeks arguing with them about the order, I was told I wasn't getting a new one despite paying for it, and when I finally got sent a new one, it arrived after the time I needed it (supposed to be a Christmas gift).I now have placed another very large order and was told it would arrive on a specific date to find it has been pushed back by 2 weeks. I was relying on this order because I am going on holiday and I now won't get these items in time. I ordered this with 2 weeks clearance to make sure I'd get the items on time but still ASOS can't deliver within that window. I swear they do this to people to try and get them to buy into the next day delivery costs. It's a total joke.

Decided to return one item out of the four I ordered and was shocked when I seen a top worth £32 was refunded £10.40. I contacted customer services and was told the entire discount I received had been deducted from that one item as the discount code was now expired! Absolutely disgusting, wouldn't have used the code or bought anything from them if I knew this beforehand. Their discount codes are clearly a way of making money off people when they return items.

Spent HOURS talking to 2 people on chat, Jacob and Shannan, both giving me completely different solutions that would ultimately lead to more costs on MY part when it was THEIR faulty item. I had to call the actual customer service phone number regarding the matter because I had enough of the rude and unhelpful replies from the chat. Even on the call, they seemed disinterested and disregarded any complaints I made. What annoys me most is that they’re a huge company that can clearly afford to appease any customer complaints with good service or even a discount to shut me up. But they refuse to do so.

            My first experience with ASOS may be the last. I really love their body-type inclusivity, but my first experience with them was horrifying and stressful. I ordered 4 purchases with Premier Delivery. 3 of them was on their way but with NO FUNCTIONAL TRACKING and while I asked them again and again what was going on, they just told me to wait. I had to contact UPS myself to have it fixed... then 2 of those orders arrive later than the date I paid for them to arrive in. Remember there was 4 purchases? Yeah the last one hasn't been SHIPPED YET! They kept telling me to wait and wait and I'm having it. I told them again and again I don't want the order anymore cause I'm travelling soon (the whole reason I paid for premier delivery!) and I want a full refund, but they refuse! They were quick to take my money but won't deliver in time nor cancel a very delayed parcel. Their twitter service @ASOSHereToHelp is so automated and impersonal and eventually they start ignoring you, despite it being their fault for not delivering on their part.

            The quality of the items I've purchased from ASOS is always great, which is why I give them 2 stars.  However, their customer service and return procedure is HORRIBLE.  It is so bad that I refuse to shop here anymore.  After ordering a dress on April 12th for a special occasion (and paying extra for faster shipping), I ordered a size 8 and received a size 14.  After noticing this I tried to find a phone number to reach out to ASOS to see if they could overnight me the correct size, since the mistake was not mine.  Once I realized there was no customer service number I chatted someone inquiring about the overnight shipping.  Whoever I was chatting with told me this was not possible that I would have to purchase a new dress, pay for overnight shipping, then return the wrong size dress and receive a refund.  Instead of ordering the correct size I simply decided just to return the dress and get a refund. I returned the dress on April 18th.  It is May 29th and I have yet to receive an email stating they've received my item nor have I received my $70 refund.  I was just chatting with someone in customer service asking about this and after about 5 minutes he comes back to tell me that their system is 'down' and to check back in 30 minutes... then he ends the chat session.Not happy with this company and their customer service!!!

            I am an Asos client for a long time and I came to the conclusion everything is ok while there is no issue with your order.But now for the first time I have to beat the incompetence of their customer care.After 10 days my order was not updated so I have contacted the customer service. I have talked with BLANE who was not able to tell me if the order left the deposit or not but just to wait for more days, selling me confusing information about the postal services/courier. I usually receive my Asos order via courier with a tracking number. He told to me about postal delays in my area but after that he told me about the order being sent via courier. So after talking with him I have no idea if the order was sent via postal services or via courier or if it was really shipped. When I asked if the package left their deposit he just closed the chat in my face.I hope I will receive this order but the new one will never happen from my side.

            Always been a happy costumer until today. Received some white boots with marks all over them, a faulty product. Writing to costumerservice was a bad idea though, not helpful at all, short answers from a person, Devon, that seemed like they didn't want to work in costumerservice or might as well just be a robot. Only offer they could give, was for me to go through the trouble with sending the product back, even though I sent pictures taken right after unpacking. Very displeased with this experience and service, certainly not gonna shop here again.

            Will not be ordering from ASOS again - disgraceful customer service sloppy, rude and inefficient - how long does it take to process a return?? Apparently they can take as  long as they like! I have to keep nagging. I am very uncomfortable with the way they treat customers with disdain - no updates like normal companies.

            I wouldn't have given even a single star. I regret that why didn't I go through the reviews before ordering. I placed an order worth 200 CAD. And it has been a month I am neither sent the tracking number nor did i receive my package on the estimated delivery time period. When i contacted the customer service they say that wait further more for another 20 Days. Also they said ...inquire about it from your local postage service as we don't have tracking number. How un professional is that. My package is not here and I have to go around searching my local post offices. The customer service itself is pathetic. I would never make future purchases from ASOS a pathetic place to order.

            Worst customer service ever!I wanted a simple invoice after paying for my order but on their website it says that you have to wait 45 days after your order in order to ask for an invoice. That's already absurd. Nevertheless, uncontent with their long waiting time for issuing such a simple document, when I asked them for an invoice 45 days after my purchase, they replied saying that they need 30 working days to issue one!!!!! That is INSANE! An invoice should be issued upon payment. You don't go to the supermarket to buy groceries and receive an invoice 75 days later. What's so difficult about making one? I'm not even sure that this is legal. I paid for something and I want an invoice! As a consumer that's one of my most basic right and I don't understand how they so unashamedly deny it!

            DPD can never find my address and so I find myself speaking to ASOS customer service quite often. It’s so frustrating as every time someone messages me back it’s a different person who clearly has not read the rest of the conversation, and so I seem to be asked for my details again in each of their replies. They say they can’t redirect my parcel, and they don’t seem to care enough to speak to DPD to give them directions for me. However having worked at the head office of a clothing company myself, I know that these things can be done. I’m going away in a few days and I know for a fact I won’t be receiving my parcel!

            I have ordered an item from this company and have paid for evening delivery. It did not arrived on time. When I contact customer service, they are totally bad as one of just close the chat on me. If they want to play like this with me, that's fine, I do the same to them. I asked for a refund for my shipping fee, but they refused to answer the question and instead said something nonsense. So if you want to purchase something from this company, don't!! You will get your product but will end up wasting money and time. The service are just unacceptable! I would even gave them zero or even minus stars for their service. This is something that trust-pilot should have looked into. This company won't make any customers to be satisfied. I guess all the good reviews are just made up not from real customers. If they think their service is good enough, why refused to answer the question about refunding shipping fee. I can see the unprofessional skills in this company and it should have not run more further. Hopefully they will go bankrupt one day and you shouldn't be supporting them.

            Have been a loyal customer to ASOS for a while, but I think I’m gonna stop it now. I returned 2 dresses because they didn’t fit me, but I didn’t get the correct refund amount, because they combine the discount amount of my whole order into the refund amount which is not fair at all!!

            I used a 20% student discount for an order totalling £229.00. When you place your order you receive an e-mail that displays each item you ordered at their full unit price and the discount is deducted at the end of the order total. I paid £197.75 which works out as a discount of 13.65%, which can't be right.I queried this with their online chat because I returned some of the items and I couldn't work out if I was being refunded the correct amount. The person I spoke to online, Marilyn, was extremely rude and cagey and refused to give me these numbers. She told me she ""calculated them using maths"" and ended the chat on me without solving my query.Well, I've used the same maths to calculate my discount and the numbers don't add up. I spent a lot of money here and I'm not convinced I'm being correctly refunded. I will not be using this service again.

Every time I contact them asking where my order is I get the same useless response. They always tell me to wait 24 hours before contacting then after that they say I have to wait a whole week (!!) before they can track where it is even though I paid for NEXT DAY delivery? It just doesn’t make sense?? And as this has happened to me frequently i always complain and they just tell me that it’s out of their control?? Which if it’s happening so frequently then they should probably get a handle on things and sort it out. It’s so frustrating.

            Reading all these reviews makes me wonder why I ever shopped with asos. Ordered an item and was sent the wrong item, the very unhelpful customer service team told me it was likely to be an isolated case and to order again and return the first item. I did and the second item arrived wrong again. I have now paid for the item twice and not received it once. This alone would be quite annoying, but what has motivated me to write a review is the appalling customer service. The ""chat"" team take so long to respond to every message, respond with generic responses and offer no flexibility for their customers. Both times I was just told to return the item, I was given no apology no compensation - even though they acknowledged that it was a mistake of one of their staff members to tell me to order again.

            What happend to ASOS?! I’m appalled with their recent service. First they use the worst delivery company, my parcels are left in front of my door and I live on a very busy street. If they leave it with the neighbour - they don’t write down the house number so I need to knock on people’s doors until I find my parcel. But that’s something that I could go around. Now, last couple of experiences were so frustrating - for the start, I was missing the item from my order, after I’ve pointed that out, they’ve sent the new pair of shoes but I never got those as well so had to conatact them AGAIN about my situation. Fine. It happens. Let’s go on. I bought 2 dresses and 1 didn’t fit me so I’ve returned it. Waited for them to confirm they’ve received the item - NOTHING. Had to chat with them AGAIN. They’ve refunded me. Fine. Still can handle it. Ordered dress and it didn’t fit me. Returned it , but only to have another, just in different size. Got the email this morning claiming I will be refunded. Contacted them AGAIN, guy is telling me I was refunded because it wasn’t in stock just an hour ago but it’s in stock now so I can make a purchase again (yeah right, and to pay for a new postage). After I told him I had so many negative experiences with ASOS lately he replied they almost never make errors and that this is a rare case and if that’s all I needed today that I can close the chat. That’s the way you treat customers, well done! Clearly there is so many incompetent people lately working with ASOS which is such a shame as I LOVED shopping with them and spent hundreds (if not thousands) of pounds there. Well, they won’t see my pennies ever again. Seeing all these negative comments really made me think that people who work there are actually sabotaging the company.

            I bought from ASOS for years but when things for wrong their customer service is absolutely shocking. I often order things on next day delivery, often they don't turn up the next day and I am simply told to wait. Constant generic responses recieved about an on going issue and so the issue takes a life time to resolve because the customer service agents are too busy cutting and pasting what seems appropriate when if they actually read the email trail they would see it is not. I also regularly get incorrect items recieved, one example being when I ordered a mens converse t shirt for my partner but recieved some lady underwear!Mistakes happen but you barely get a sorry, nevermind any recompense for the inconvenience caused.

            I ordered a pair of jeans off this website and they didn’t fit. They have free returns so I returned the jeans to my local UPS store. My UPS store did not issue me any sort of recipt. You are supposed to receive an email within 10 business days that your item has been received and an refund is being issued to your account. Its been 15 business days and my package has not been received yet. I have contacted customer care multiple times and they copy and paste the same message. They require proof of postage to look into this, although the other forms of proof of postage they require are included in the package that was sent back. I have voiced my concerns through their livechat and it always goes back to “you need proof of postage.” Which I explained I do not have. I asked this one person who was working the live chat a question, and her response was “now I see I have answered all your questions, I’m going to go ahead and end this chat.” and closed the chat So I started emailing. I have been passed on to different people and eventually asked if I could set up a phone call with them (because they don’t have a call center!) They said yes and asked me when. I told them the day and time I’m free, which was today, and I have not received a phone call from them. Instead, yesterday I received an email from a different member of customer service saying they were looking into this and will get back to me soon-still haven’t heard anything. So disappointed in them! I have lost $50 that I don’t think I will get back. Seeing that many people are experiencing this problem makes me feel less alone and stupid but more angered.

Below is the email that I received this morning:“Hello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for your items.It’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.”THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE LEADERSHIP TEAM SHOULD BE CONCERNED. I have never made a public complaint against an organization but this one deserves public awareness as they have my $218 and I have no products and they are no longer willing to address.

The advertising is incorrect but the customer service team were no help at all.

            They advertise next day delivery if you order before 11PM, but it never works - the stuff doesn't turn up, ASOS don't know where it is, and it ends up turning up the next day when it's too late. Don't advertise something you can't actually fulfil.

            Sharing a similar experience with so many other customers. Ordered two pairs of shoes 10 days ago and haven’t received the order. Customer service told me to wait 12 more days. Can’t cancel the order yet. Would need to wait until the actual delivery then arrange a return. Not worth buying from ASOS.

            My order was supposed to arrive two days after I placed it as I paid extra to ensure this and it did not. Three days after the package did not arrive FedEx contacted me and informed me the package was lost and would not be arriving.  My order consisted of an outfit and a bathing suit I planned on wearing that weekend on my bachelorette trip to Cabo, San Lucas. I contacted ASOS and they told me there was nothing they can do tholepin me. I lost over $80.00 on this website, do not trust them!!!

            One star is being too generous. I would rate this brand and company ZERO stars if I could. First of all, as soon as the order was late, I contacted Customer Service and they said I had to wait another 20 DAYS before they could do anything about it. When my order did arrive, not only was the order 9 days late, IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM AND THE WRONG SIZE. Not to mention, the product is poor quality. This was my first AND LAST time buying from this company.

            Ordered some items paid for via an ASOS gift card. One of said items was ASOS DESIGN 2 pack baseball cap in black and white. ASOS sent me, to what I can only describe to be a very damaged/stained cap. I then send the hat back for an ""exchange"" only to receive an email from ASOS saying they'd issued me a refund which will be in my account within 10 days (Not convenient seeing as I needed the hat for a holiday I am going on next week). When I called customer service, I spoke to one lady who gave me a load of false information. I then call up again to chase to speak a Scottish young lady who, albeit out of her control, was EXTREMELY unhelpful - Saying that ASOS will not send me an exchange, saying that they will NOT reimburse me for the delivery charge I'll now have to pay to receive the hats AGAIN - Basically, all I could get was a ""sorry, it is our fault, but there is nothing we can do"" - JUDGING BY THERE 1 STAR TRUSTPILOT SCORE BASED ON ALMOST 7,000 REVIEWS - ASOS CLEARLY COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS OR REPEAT BUSINESS

            On multiple occasions I have been sent the wrong items in the wrong sizes, they have subsequently run out of the correct item. Customer service were less than helpful; not only in the chat did they clearly not read my message correctly, they didn’t answer my questions and sounded in a hurry. For example when I said I had been sent the wrong dress, the reply I got was: I will have a look at why your order was sent to the wrong address. Very frustrating. I order online because my working hours make it difficult for me to shop in store. However I have now not had an outfit for events due to the time and money wasted at ASOS.

            AVOID at all cost! I spent 5 hours trying to solve issues their poor and incompetent customer service caused me. First I tried to chat online with an agent. She said hi and disappeared. I kept waiting for more than 15minutes. I texted again to no avail so I ended the chat. Shortly after, I started another chat  and I was informed that the premier delivery won't work for my international shipping just to be informed by a third agent after I placed my order with standard shipping that it would have worked. I contacted them the third time to make sure my sizes were correct since the UK store provides different conversions than the US store. Everyone tells me something different until it finally became clear to me that I got the wrong sizes. So I contacted them for a fourth time to cancel my order but they would not do it because 60mins have passed since I placed my order. Of course it passed while I was moving from inept agent to another seeking information and help. I tried to at least have them amend the order and they wouldn't either. The thing is the estimated delivery date is too late for me. I'm traveling and won't be back before end of August and they keep repeating that I could return the order. They are robots. They copy-paste the same response to all concerns. How am I going to return it if I will be gone by the time it arrives?! Worse yet, I only have 45 days to return and they would not extend it since they are the reason I am in this miserable situation. After I insisted to talk to a manager or someone who could help, Patrick who has been talking like a robot decided to end the chat. The shady business is run by a bunch of pathetic, incompetent and dishonest agents. Story short is because of their poor handling of the situation and misleading customer service, I now ended up with an order that has wrong sizes, won't arrive on time and won't be able to return within their 45days. P.S. I chatted with Adeena, Salman, Charlotte and finally Patrick.

            They advertise price promise on their website on non - asos non sale product. They will refund you the price on the next purchase. Fair enough. However when try to claim on your order they say, they can't do it. They even do not take the time to read emails properly. I pointed out NEXT has the same dress for £20 less, they replied since I bought the dress from NEW LOOK (which is wrong just because it starts with ""NE"" it doesn't mean it's the same shop), I can't have a price promise. I did spend £110 on order 408481734 bought from Asos, but they refuse to keep their word on price promise. Guess what? If this does not get resolved, I will buy it from Next.Update: they confirmed that i get no money back garantee after two days. By that time the dress on the Next website was gone. Result? I am returning all the merchandise I bought in the past week from Asos. That's almost £300 worth of clothing. You lost a customer

How does that even happen. I spoke to customer service and all they said was they can only apologise. I pay for next day delivery, pointless. Then I returned them and they have the cheek to send me the wrong size again, atleast this time they sent me the correct right and left shoes.

It was my first order so I thought, eh maybe they run small. I ordered a second pair of sandals (that were not wide fit) in my size and they were MASSIVE. I’m talking like at least 2 sizes too big. I am reading over their website and they ENCOURAGE ordering multiple sizes and colors to ensure you get what you need and you send back the rest for a “full refund”. So I ordered a size down in the sandals...still massive. Then when I try to return my items, not only do they tell me they don’t refund shipping costs BUT THEY DIDN’T EVEN REFUND THE FULL SALES TAX AMOUNT. Probably thinking I wouldn’t notice, but I did.

            I advise people not to use ASOS. I ordered an item on 30th April and received a confirmation email to say my order had been received and should arrive by 8th May. On the 2nd May I received another email telling me my parcel had been despatched and later that day I checked the tracking through Hermes website which said that the item had already arrived at the local depot. However when I checked the tracking on Friday 3rd May it said that my order had been delayed but that Hermes would get the package moving again within the next 24 hours. However when I checked back five days later on the day the parcel was supposed to have arrived, the tracking hadn't changed and hadn't been updated since 3rd May. I contacted customer service through the chat. They told me my parcel could still arrive on 8th right up to midnight (Really!) so to contact them the following day. So I did but this time I was told there was nothing they could do until 7 working days after the last time the parcel was tracked. I was told by customer services the date I needed to get back in touch for them to resolve my issue was today (15th May). I also expressed my wish to complain at this point and the customer service advisor said they would pass my complaint on. So just as I had been advised I contacted customer services again today (more than two weeks since I ordered the item) to ask for a full refund and was told they can't resolve it until tomorrow. It is just ridiculous. I just keep getting told a later and later date! I am a busy working working mother of two young children and haven't got the time to keep contacting them. Other companies I have used would have resolved the issue right away. I will never use ASOS again.

            Literally can't explain how bad their customer service team is. The lack of answers and explanation baffles me. Paid for next day delivery and the guy doesn't show up but i receive a message saying sorry I missed you.... I asked for a refund as the event takes place tomorrow so there is no need for the items anymore and they just come back with the sassiest responses. The Head of Client Services really needs to reassess the care and training of this department.

            Hands down the worst customer service I have ever had. I found the exact same item on their website listed twice but with a $33 price difference as one was in their 'tall' range and the other in their normal. Staff confirmed it was the identical item.  Upon asking if they would provide it to me for the lower price  as they did not have my size in the cheaper listing I was told "" we cannot help you that is the price if there is no other issue you can close the screen"". The live chat was horrendously slow and beyond rude. A shame because their products are so good. Makes me double think using them.

            I was a regular customer and didn't have issues until now. I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered by the 30th of April. When the parcel never arrived, I was never notified about a delay or any other issue occurred. When I chased their team, the representatives gave me faulty information about the parcel that was first damaged and then they told me that was just delayed and I need to wait till the 11th. Of course, the parcel was never delivered and the tracking was never updated. When I chased them again, I had to repeat again the history as none of them were reading the previous messages. After 10 days, they said that Hermes informed them that the parcel was damaged on the transit and was returned to them around the 1st of May and that I had to wait for the refund although previous to that they told me to wait for the delivery till the 11th.  Again no update for the next 4 days and I had to chase them for another 4-5 times in order to process the refund for an order that was not delivered for the past 15 days! Needless to say that none of the representatives offered any compensation or apologized for what happened and were only responding with canned responses and templates! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT USE THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY AGAIN! AVOID!

            Same basically as Anna there typed. Finnish customer, placed an order on 2nd of May, got an e-mail on 6th from UB Send that the parcel is relabelled for delivery. Parcel was supposed to be here in 14th. It was not, I also didn't get any type of tracking info with the JJFI code, and had two separate ones from the UB Send. Contacted Finnish Posti, they said that ASOS just has shipped a huge ammount of parcels to Finnish customers with faulty tracking codes and Posti is unable to tell that will the Finnish ASOS customers ever receíve the parcels they ordered. Contacted ASOS, they say that I would have to wait to 23rd to able to ask about refund - that's plus 10 days to their standard 25 day refund timeframe. I asked to show the company policy, which supposedly prevents them from doing an immediate refund. They didn't do that, linked me to a page about UK Precise Delivery Service (Finland is not even on the list of countries to which they provide that service). The page had zero mentionings about ASOS refund policies. Got an immediate impression, that the extra 10 days is for them to use some kind of loop hole and not make the refunds in case the parcels don't actually reach their Finnish customers before that 23rd. On top of that the customer service was quite weak, not rude, just not helpful. Thoughts about an internet scam are now floating in my head.

            I spent £131 pounds on gym gear and got 20 off as over £120 spent total £111. One pair of asos own brand leggings cost £38 pounds and ripped at gym on second use. Seriously poor quality as washed once. I applied for a replacement or credit or refund. They did not even apologise and refunded only £18 instead of £38. They took the original £20 off deal off the price of the faulty product. I complained and asked for at leat a proportioanate discounted refund eg £31 and they still did not honour it. Absolutely appauled! So disappointing. Myself, friends and family will not be using. It turns out others i have spoken to have found asos gym gear equally poor quality but they do not allow reviews so I cannot even warn others! Expensive mistake

            Ordered a few items around 10 days ago, to be delivered at a local collection point, was sent numerous e-mails that it had been delivered and that I had 10 days to collect, went to pick up after three days to find it had never been delivered to the collection point. Was then automatically sent back to there depot and I have to wait up to 7 days for a refund, for products that I never had the chance to collect! The only way I can now get them is by re-ordering and spending more without even receiving the refund. Also funny how, when this was ordered they were running a 20% student discount, which has now gone back to the normal 10. And the best I have been offered is a 15% discount now. So I have to pay more money that I had originally planned to get the same items two weeks later. Embarrassing for an online only company.

There is no customer service and they will charge you LONG before you receive your package- IF you receive it at all. They straight up lie about delivery dates, so plan at least a month later than they project, and be prepared to be disappointed when your stuff arrives.

            What a shocking company. You pay for next day delivery. Hermes loses the parcel. You call and they expect you to resolve the issue with Hermes yourself rather than ASOS doing it given you have paid an annual fee (Hermes want asos to resolve with them). Hermes admit losing the parcel and you call ASOS three times to explain this which has cost £14.25. All they say is you have to wait 24 hours. 24 hours fo what? We’d already waited a week. AwfulCustomer service by telephone. Expect a short call to cost you about £5. Then expect the following,They don’t listen to what you are sayingThey don’t try to understand what you are sayingThey don’t address the point you are makingThey contradict themselves They make no attempt to resolve the problem.They charge premium rates if you call them.Live chat simply close the chat and cut you off. All the above applies and offers the same routine and nonsense.Eventually I got a refund through contacting with facebook messenger but they can’t refund the outrageous call costs.therefore i’m over £14 lighter by calling the so called customer care team. All the person did on messenger was to confirm what we’d been explaining to tell them all along.Now they say that they won’t reimburse my calls because. Are you ready?

            Their “intelligent return” process involved only a few simple steps. The “few simple steps” include filling up a form much like ones where you are signing up a complete new account with an online shop. You are required to put in your name, email address, full mailing address, phone number, order number, garment code, garment description, amount of the purchase, quantity.. that’s not the end, then u select the way to return it, and any options u choose, it will return a ‘We are sorry, the service you have selected is temporarily down. Please check back later when normal service will be restored. Thank you for your patience’. When you write in to their chat service asking for help, u will get response such as ‘change your browser, clear your cache, opsss nothing we can do, bye bye!’ So if U want to purchase anything from ASOS, make sure u don’t return it as you just can’t!

            Shocking, have always used asos and have spent hundreds of pounds with them. I had to get in touch with them to find out where my items were after 2 weeks of waiting! Just to be told that I would have to wait for it to be returned to them by their courier which would be another 7-10 working days and then wait 5-10 working days for my refund. This will be well over a month they have had my money. Their response emails and robotic and obvious templates. Makes me furious. I even told them to keep the money and give me a voucher instead, I just need the clothes!!!!!!

            Where do i begin, I am a regular shopper with Asos, i have next day delivery on my account and check the app on a daily basis. Over the past 5 days i have had nothing but problems. The first problem happened on Saturday, with a technical glitch on the site which listed the incorrect delivery address. Being made aware of this i contacted dhl to cancel this and return to asos, and contacted asos, yet the parcel was still delivered to the incorrect address, with tracking details stating god knows who that has signed for it. Despite me kicking up a fuss, i still made another order the next day, Conveniently i collected this order today from my click and collect and then from the 9 items that should have been received only 1 item was in the parcel. Coincidence or deliberate. So far i am playing email back and forth with no resolution, I will be sure to not shop with asos again!

            Worst customer service for such an established company! Paid for premier delivery and still haven't received my order 6 days later. Customer service consists of being passed around to different people via email, and being told that managers in the company do not exist. I was told that if I had paid for one off next day delivery I was able to get a refund, however paying premier I wasn't able to get one. So you are punished for paying more. I was then told that I can't cancel my premier subscription so can continue to enjoy next day delivery throughout the year. The customer ""care"" made me feel as if they were mocking me and not handling my queries at all. Judging by all the other reviews I'm not the only one. Will NOT be using ASOS again and will be telling anyone and everyone that will listen not to either. So disappointed in this established company.

            I was sent the wrong item and customer service agent gave me a generic script about how I have to wait until they receive it back to refund me. On top of that, they tell me the original item I ordered is out of stock and I can only replace my order for a different item with a different transaction. They literally do nothing to correct the issue, send me out of my way to send the item back, and issue a refund only when they receive their incorrect merchandise back.The original order was for a 100% leather jacket and I was instead sent a 100% polyurethane Asos branded leather jacket that looked nothing like the jacket I ordered and the price difference was significant.

            Don’t buy from ASOS! Absolutely appalling customer and service! Ordered over £200 worth of goods which have never been delivered. DPD claim they delivered the parcel to my address to someone called Sam.But I was home at the time of delivery and noone called Sam lives at my address. They then informed me that DPD were revisiting the place of delivery on Friday. Given what they have said they presumably should have come to my house but, of course, no one did. So I would now think they must have gone back to the address it was delivered to and either have the parcel or at very least know which house it was delivered to. Or they have admitted they have lost the parcel. But no they are still claiming the parcel has been delivered but have yet to provide any evidence that the goods have been delivered anywhere, nevermind to me. ASOS have refused replacement or refund which is as good as calling me a liar. I have been an ASOS customer fo mqny years and wasn't requesting a refund, I just wanted the goods I ordered to be delivered. Not an unreasonable request! A quick google search shows both ASOS and DPD do this on a fairly regular basis. Have now had to escalate a claim through Paypal. Will not buy from again! Thieves!

            I have been buying from Asos weekly for the past 5+ years, and I have always received the package, sometimes their delivery time is a bit off but they never guarantee that it will be delivered by that date, it’s only an estimation and it depends on how busy they are at the time (when they have sales its only logical that it will take more time to despatch orders). My returns are always received and promptly procesed. Custumer service always replies on their chat platform and are always nice and helpful. I really don’t understand how some people have so many issues with them. Regarding quality of their products, some are good, some are bad, it is a fast fashion brand.

No compensation offered even though I pay for premier next day delivery (a service which I am not receiving), all was said to me is I can return the item for a refund if it was no longer needed.

            Asos has the worst customer service. I had a package and returned all the items using their prepaid shipping label, and the package got lost. I went to the shipping store and got proof that I sent the package, but because they didn't receive the package they said there was nothing they could do. They wouldn't transfer me to a manager, and just had an automated email sent to me every single time I demanded to speak to a manager on the phone. This was the worst customer service I have ever received and I will never buy from them again.

            Agree with a lot of the other reviews. I have a premier account and they took 12 days to deliver. Not easy to contact customer services and they will argue black is white. In fact I’m pretty sure they are trained to have passive aggressive arguments with their customers. They offer no apology or goodwill. They have never cared about customer service but stupidly I have continued to shop with them. This last experience has been so bad that I’ve just had to cut them off, I used to shop 4 times a month on average and spend hundreds each year. They’ve been so rude and treated me with such contempt that it just has to end. They’ll get no more money from me. I work in retail and everyone I know feels the same. It’s a real shame they can’t/won’t sort this out as they really could be an amazing company.

            These guys are truly awful in their care for customers. You would expect that such a huge organisation invest more into satisfying their customers - but they really don't. Do not support the company, avoid supporting them until they can improve their customer services. I paid for standard delivery and this stretched beyond 8 days. I contacted them through their inefficient and odd messaging service and i requested details in regards to my items as well as some form of compensation for being unable to deliver my items in the time frame that they provided and that i paid for. They said that there will be no compensation and that in fact the delivery date will be within the NEXT 10 days. It's absolutely awful, I haven't received the products that I have paid for - I'm uninterested and am currently chasing a full refund.

            Besides being an online shop with a lot of variety, they have a terrible customer service which is a deal breaker for me. I have to be honest - most of my orders have arrived without a problem - but when you have an issue, have in mind you'll be wasting your time contacting them.It's probably the worst CS I've ever got - three times I've spoken to them for different issues and they don't seem to care about their customers experience, all they say is: it's on their ""T&Cs"", which at this point I may have to read the whole thing in case it says they can steal money from you.My last issue was regarding a discount weekend they issued, where they offered a different discount according to your spending - I've met their conditions for the greatest amount but then had to return one item - Of course, I understand I don't meet the conditions for the full discount anymore, but was expecting them to honor the lower spending discount (since I meet those conditions).Well, no. If you decide to spend more and for some reason return something, you'll lose any discount, even tho you still meet the conditions.  The worst? They don't care about your experience. They send you the link to their T&Cs and tell you there's nothing they can do (As I'm talking to a robot).They clearly don't listen and show no empathy with their customers. I haven't even been told why they can't honor the promo (in a logical way, not only because of their policy) and they don't see to be looking for a solution for this concern in other to offer better policies for their customers.Disappointed.

            I’ve been shopping with asos since 2007 and I’ve never had a problem they couldn’t or didn’t solve. I had bought a RI bag from them and after 6 months of owning it, the item had begun to wear away. I contacted asos and they issued me with a full refund. Only once asos had sent me two different sizes shoes, but luckily I was able to get an exchange. Next day deliveries always arrive. I have the same amazing delivery people each time from DPD and Hermes. My returns have always arrived and been either exchanged or refunded using collectplus tracking. The only thing I will say is that refunds do take some time after the parcel has been returned. But that’s to be expected. I received a damaged eyeshadow palette along with a brand new one so now I have two minus a yellow shade. I had bought a acne light thingy by Foreo for my cousin that didn’t work for her. After a week she sent it back and I got my refund. Asos customer service, in my opinion, has been good to me and I will continue to shop with them as they DO! care about their customers.

            After being a regular customer of ASOS for several years I am disappointed by the increasing poor customer service. Paying for the next day delivery I expect that the deliveries will arrive next day but more and frequently I am finding that my order is not reaching me next day. I contacted customer   services and they basically told me that it’s ok for them to do that as that’s their policy, with no consideration for me or even an apology. Beside the poor service there is a lack of stock and range of brands as it seems most lines have been removed. Save your self the bother and shop elsewhere

            Wow - I have never had issues with ASOS until this week. Out of three parcels, two were delayed (one still is and I don’t know when to expect it) and one has been LOST. All parcels contained now sold out items purchased with 25% discount that has ended now. Absolutely fuming - they have started using DHL delivery service and this is where the issues come from. Never had a problem when they were using Hermes/DPD. Have been massively put off buying from there and will tell my friends about my experience.

            After receiving an order, I had to return some items, mostly to get a new size. A week later I received an email saying that I had been refunded the money, and due to the promo code used, I've only been refunded half the money. I spoke to them on the live chat, the girl seemed nice, but barely helpful at all. I wanted to understand why they refunded me the three items, rather than sending a new size, as required, when it was clearly all in stock. She gave me some BS about the item being out of stock when processed, although it was in stock literally two hours later.Two hours on the live chat resulted in her passing it on to their specialist team, who would email me. Email response has been fairly quick, but each email has been from a new person and all of them completely useless. They are not taking responsibility for their own mistakes and their solution is for me to spend £100 more.Have always been satisfied with ASOS, but this so-called customer care is a massive joke.

            I agree with another person who said they used to be a fan of ASOS. Me too. But the last couple of times I have dealt with them have been extremely disappointing. Either the items were of deplorable quality, fit etc, or the refunds are not given when you send back an item in good faith. And in the last case (that's certainly the last time for me) the item was a warm winter coat with a zipper that doesn't do up. How is that 'fit for purpose'? And getting a refund for the wasted $150? Forget it. Their system didn't even register the purchase in my account, and so they wouldn't give me a returns slip number. I provided all the proof, ie paypal receipt, order number, my id etc, but they just stonewalled me when I tried to get past their BS with facts. What a crazy bunch - if they think they can stay in business that way. I will certainly warn everyone I know that they'd better watch out if anything they order isn't up to scratch - and I think neither ASOS's products nor their returns process is up to scratch. So, basically if you feel like a gamble with your money, buy from ASOS - but if you prefer to know that when you spend money on clothing you are actually going to get what you paid for, then DON'T GO NEAR THEM. Really hopeless and a wonder they're still going really. If I took $150 from someone in the street I would go to jail, but they just get away with it.

            The one star is because there's no choice for No Star. I have been a fan of ASOS for years but lately, have noticed a difference in customer service and shipping. Recently made a big purchase and qualified for the Free 2 day shipping. Waited and waited but no package arrived. I checked the status again and it was being sent back to the warehouse. While I contacted USPS to get it sorted out, they said the address was wrong therefore it will be sent back to ASOS. Before hanging up, I confirmed the address and it was correct. I attempted to email, chat, facebook message ASOS about the matter -- only to be told there's nothing they can do other than give me a refund. I checked the order, the address is correct. Why is it being sent back without any communication from ASOS or shipping company? Now I am being told I won't get those items back and will have to reorder. The advise they gave is they will refund and if I still want them I'd need to re-purchase the items again. WT. F. Those items are not even available anymore. Why on earth would you run an online retail shop with bad shipping procurement and bad communication?! Honestly, I love the variety of what ASOS has to offer, but this low level of customer service and unable to deliver what was purchased is a huge letdown.

            I have been a customer of ASOS since they started. Up until before Xmas I would have given them 5 stars as I couldn’t fault them. However, in the last 4 months I’ve not had one order delivered on time, as a consequence of them moving from DPS as their preferred courier. I’ve had one order delivered with items missing , and another where one item had clearly been worn and another was damaged. This is not ASOS as I know them. They offer a great range  and reasonable pricing however everything else is currently letting them down. They’ve lost me as a customer and I never thought I’d say that. Shame ASOS.

            Wow, how bad have ASOS become?!?!For starters, they *used* to use DPD for their next day service. A brilliant courier, never any issues whatsoever. Could choose your own delivery slot, driver was always on time, was literally NEVER late in all the 100+ times I used ASOS' next day option.Who have they started using now, as a mere cost cutting exercise..?DHL Parcel UK, (a.k.a UK Mail with a new frock on).As most of us know, UK Mail are widely regarded as one of the most tragically shambolic couriers ever to grace the planet. Constant delays for no apparent reason, drivers not showing up, awful tracking, little-to-no delivery notifications etc etc.So ASOS' premier delivery (i.e. next day delivery for a year) has gone from being absolutely superb, to downright obsolete, as the courier will likely never actually deliver on the next day.So save yourself a tenner and don't bother signing up to that garbage.Secondly - their customer service... wow.I don't think I've ever experienced such a can't-be-bothered attitude from customer service staff?It does beg the question: why on earth do they actually hire these people on chat?You may as well chat to your nearest wall about your order/delivery as it will be able to assist just as much as ASOS' live chat team.I spoke to an absolute cretin called Jasmitha, who literally had no idea what she was banging on about.No help whatsoever, she may as well have been replying in some sort of indigenous Papuan language, spoken only by tribes untouched by the western world, as that would've probably made more sense to me than the drivel she was spouting about my delivery.Oh and they won't offer any sort of apology/discount/reimbursement no matter how much they mess you about, so don't waste your time asking.As I said earlier, ASOS used to be great, my go-to site if I needed to grab a few bits of clothing quickly.Now, I shall be shopping elsewhere, as there *must* be better options out there.A gang of chimps could set a rival company up that would shame the current day ASOS when it comes to customer service & overall customer satisfaction.

            We have been shopping from Asos store online for a few years. Pleased with good sales, there is a lot to choose from. We once received a wrong item and returns were very easy from Lithuania to UK, and it didn't cost. Received the correct item pretty fast too. And you know sending items back is one of the most annoying things to do...great when things can be done easily.We always appreciate the free delivery to Lithuania option, as Asos has some nice items that are worth to take a look (and for a good price).

            I recently purchased an item from ASOS using my premier account so I could have next day delivery for some work clothes needed for a new job, got an email on the day of delivery saying it wouldn’t be delivered so I went on live chat and was told they weren’t able to look into it until the following day, which would be too late, so I questioned why they couldn’t contact the driver and was told they couldn’t do that because there was still time for it to arrive and then they abruptly ended the chat before I could reply and without resolving my issue. I called up after spending a good amount of time trying to find a contact number since they don’t have it on their website and make it very difficult to speak with them, and was told that the delivery van had broken down (not what I was previously told) and that once the parcel has changed hands with Hermes delivery there is no way to contact them?! I asked why they couldn’t contact and find out if it could still be delivered and was told it’s in their contract with Hermes that they can’t speak to the delivery driver once they have the parcel...so they aren’t allowed to contact the company that they pay for their service? I then emailed ASOS and was told that they had tried to deliver my item and nobody was home, there were several people home and we have CCTV to prove that nobody tried to deliver the items, but apparently the photo sent as proof of delivery of a blurred black screen is better evidence than our CCTV 🤔 so I’ve been told 3 different versions of why my parcel wasn’t delivered and was offered rude and unhelpful customer service, this is on top of countless parcels being left on my front door step and then stolen or left in dustbins, and even seeing delivery drivers go past my house without stopping and then saying that nobody was home to sign for it. 0/10 for customer service and delivery

            I've purchased many times from Asos whilst I was living in Europe, mainly in the UK. Never had issues there, returns were easy, did not cost me money to send it back, delivery was quick and refund was settled promptly. I ordered from Asos in Canada. I was charged customs fee which literally doubled the cost of my dresses, this was not outlined or stated on the website. Being new in Canada, I had no idea that this fee is flat rate (>$50) regardless of the price of your goods as long as it exceeds $20. To make it worse, the dresses I ordered did not fit me despite using the size guide. Their clothing always run too big. I normally wear UK8-10. Nowhere in store, have I ever bought smaller sizes. On Asos, I have to scale down several sizes even when I use the sizing assistant and I answered based on actual measurements/weight. The fit is also clearly off, because every so often, if I order a couple dresses which are all the same size, one might fit while the others run down my knees. My sequin dress is dropping sequins every now and then. I've had to vacuum it up and even then there's still a couple falling off whenever it is shifted. I tried to find the loose thread and just cannot locate it cause it's black.The worst part is to return to the UK, I will be charged a shipping fee of $22+. This means, the cost of shipping and customs alone would have easily gotten me 3 dresses without the added hassle of purchasing it from overseas and having issues with sizing and having to return it. Really terrible. Do not purchase from Asos unless you live in the UK. I just missed London and hated the clothing/fashion in Canada. Can't believe this just made everything worse.

            I would advise people to be very wary of ordering expensive items on this site, especially trainers etc.As most of us order online I would expect a much better service. I ordered a pair of  £100 trainers for my son who is 13, as part of a present. He is paying half £50 that he has saved for weeks from a paper round. They were guaranteed next day delivery. Still not arrived 2 weeks later. Asos are very good at given their patter that they are looking into it and DHL are investigating. I have 8 reassuring generic emails that it is being looked into.What they are very stupid at not realising is that unless they rectify problems QUICKLY they will loose customers, not just me but younger generations that feel disgusted that a company acts like this. As a company that is  online and has no customer telephone number (which is ludicrous) I would be very cautious at ordering from them. My advise if you can get else where guaranteed delivery for a day go with that. I do not believe that they have a full process in place for order problems. I have worked as a Buyer in an international retail environment, and am fully aware problems happen. Remember Asos you only get remembered for bad experiences not good so these need to be dealt with to keep customer loyalty. As a retailer online no matter how good your stock is ASOS REMEMBER THERE IS NO ASOS WITHOUT CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY.  Please everyone preserve with any monies owed as I will and if no response I will be going through small claims court out of principle if not resolved.Update is they finally got back after about 3 weeks to say trainers were out of stock then waited another week for refund. Not good to take customers money then not have goods ASOS sort it out!

It was two days later than the expected delivery date, but everything was great and fit perfectly!I live near a major shipping hub (Toronto) so often my deliveries are faster than if I were to live in the suburbs.Asos customer service were able to get back to me within a day when I asked about the status of my order. Honestly I have not had a problem with them yet - even when I had to return an item. So I don't know if people on here are really impatient or what.If you live in Canada and order standard shipping, around a month is normal waiting time. Always buy things online with a credit card so you can dispute it, if it really takes too long.

            Horrible customer service. You pay for their premier service which is supposed to allow you to have next day deliveries but the deliveries don’t turn up, they give out fake tracking numbers and they have a No Compensation policy to rectify any mistakes on their part. Not worth the hassle shopping with them. One order ends up being a case undelivered items and at least 20 emails going back and forth. Diabolical !!

I have been without money and without my order for 2 weeks since dpd lost it.

            I have placed lots of orders with ASOS over the years and the worst I'd experienced was slow refund time. Recently (2019) however, ASOS has gone from bad to worse and I wouldn't even recommended them at all now.Possibly the rudest customer service I have ever received.ASOS advertise prices in one place, then when you get the site you have to watch because the prices usually increase. e.g. advertised at £25 > click the link to go to the item > increases to £32.ASOS told me they would honor prices when there are errors but they don't.MEGAN their customer service rep, gave me a scripted response about it being the fault of my 'internet cookies'... bare in mind I am an IT Professional, but I humored her and tried it anyway. When I told her the problem still existed and explained this wouldn't fix it, she gave me another story about broken links.When I could see she didn't have a clue what she was talking about, I asked to escalate to a manager/higher up. She said 'no I've already solved your issue' then ended the chat so I couldn't reply.This is possibly the WORST customer service I have ever received from MEGAN at ASOS.I have since been in contact with ASOS Managing Director and am taking the steps to escalate this issue.

I was contacted with Beth who didn't give me any information apart from that specialist needs to look into it, made me wait another 24 hrs without any info and disconnected with me !!!! What kind of specialist ?? Really? You need a specialist to contact DPD and find out where is my order ?!Where are your customer service skills????

            Worst customer service ever!!!!! I was supposed to receive my order a week ago but never got it, so I emailed them. They told me to contact my post office to see if I could track it down, and once that had been done, to wait three more weeks before getting back in touch with them. Three weeks is quite unreasonable in my opinion, so I waited a week and explained that I didn't think this was fair. The last thing I wanted was for the order to be forgotten about. They told me I still needed to wait the full three weeks before contacting them again. Terrible customer service considering my order was already delayed. This was my first time ordering from ASOS and definitely will not be ordering again.

            Here I am, trying to fix this negative publication bias (only people who had a negative experience write a review here).The clothes came to the Netherlands withing 2 working days after I ordered. The live tracking of DPD is very precise, and I got a chance to catch the delivery guy to try my new clothes straight away.  2 out of 3 dresses didn't fit (they were too small, UK size 2. This never happened to me before because I'm tiny). I sent them back and got a full refund 9 days after.Asos is a great and reliable company, don't be scared by all the negative reviews.

            If only I could rate them less than 1 star, I would. Horrible customer service. Got a promo for free 2-day express shipping, but they gave me standard shipping when I got the confirmation email.When I got on the chat to ask them to switch this, the first agent had said my email that I gave was wrong and immediately ended the chat without even letting me respond. I only have 1 email address, and thought maybe I misspelled it, so I copy/paste it and put it in the message that I'm sure my email is right, and that I received my order confirmation on it and that my ASOS account is linked to my Google account and that's how I sign in.The second agent said it was wrong, and I told her to double check because I was positive it was right! She told me to hold on and wait, and never came back.Left me hanging close to the 1-hour window to be over to cancel my order. Decided to stop waiting and just cancel my order right away.

            1 star is generous. Asos have the actual WORST customer service imaginable!!!!! I have no idea how they get away with it. TERRIBLE.I contacted their 'customer service' team on facebook. The worst excuse of customer service I have EVER experienced. I initially spoke to someone regarding the issue on the 12th. 5 days went by and the issue still wasn't resolved which is not an acceptable time frame for such a simple issue. Aside from the excessive amount of time taken to deal with my issue, I have spoken to 13 different members of their customer service team on facebook and not one helped one bit. Half way through after sending multiple messages to asos explaining the issue I received this message back. 'Hi Chloe, thanks for getting in touch about your premier delivery subscription - I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble purchasing premier. As your order purchasing premier was cancelled, it wont be active on your ASOS account and you'll need to repurchase. You can only use your Premier Delivery subscription on the same ASOS website that you bought it from. For example, if you bought Premier Delivery on the ASOS UK site, your subscription would only be valid for deliveries within the UK. In addition, you’re not able to use your Premier Delivery subscription for any orders placed on any of our other ASOS sites. You can find out which country your Premier Delivery subscription is for, by logging into ‘My Account’ and clicking on the ‘Premier Delivery’ tab. This reply was COMPLETELY unrelated to the issue I was contacting about and is clear this person had not bothered to read my issue or where it was up to what so ever. I asked twice to speak to someone via phone after getting nowhere in 3 days and as stated by their website, if requested I am entitled to a phone call. This was denied by two members of the team. One individual offered to have someone call me and the call never came. Eventually I found a contact number myself and spoke to their customer service team. Both members were more helpful but still barely helpful. They advised me that to take the issue further I would be best to contact the customer experience team. I went online to find the email which I could not find so asked an online agent. The response was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. I am appalled that they would employ people so incapable of customer service into a customer service roll.Hi Chloe,Here is your ASOS chat transcript:Chloe [15:23:44] email addressASOS[15:23:45] You're now chatting to Morgan[15:23:45] ASOS CHAT UPDATE: Reconnected[15:23:46] You're now chatting to Morgan[15:23:52] Someone will be in touch soonChloe [15:23:53] hello[15:24:00] sorry my chat disconnectedASOS[15:24:01] I can see that we have let you know multiple times that IT are currently looking into your premier delivery issue, ChloeChloe [15:24:29] how rude okay i will be sure to mention you in my email too[15:24:40] its okay forget it i will contact the person i just spoke toASOS[15:26:16] We don't have a customer experience email to direct you to, Chloe, you have been misinformed.Chloe [15:27:14] well that's just a lie as i just got it off someone elseASOS[15:28:10] ASOS have ended the chatAny images that were sent within the chat will not show in the transcript.The service is inefficient and I have wasted so much money and not had my issue resolved.

Initially, I was messaging someone at ASOS to explain my issue. I was then sent a returns label and returned the bag via collect plus. I received my refund, no questions asked. I received timely communication from ASOS and the entire sake and return was hassle free. I will always use ASOS and never once had a problem with their services.

I returned two dresses because the fit was so awkward. I used their pre-paid address label. Weeks later, they have not refunded me because they say they never got the merchandise back. They have asked me for tracking information - but I used their label so they should have the tracking information. I did an on-line chat with the rudest person alive at their web site and I still have no refund. They refuse to track their own shipping label and just keep asking me for the information.

            DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY! I had previously ordered from this company on several occasions, however I will never again. I have had an ongoing dispute with ASOS since July 2018 and it still is not resolved. They have scammed me for £545.00. I ordered several items from them on June 30th and when they delivered my parcel no one was at home, so rather than leaving a note to re-arrange the delivery or leaving it at the post office they left it with my neighbour without my permission. Firstly this is against consumer rights. Secondly I received no text/ note to let me know my parcel was left with my neighbour, until my neighbour knocked on my door to give me the parcel. When I received the parcel from my neighbour, firstly it was a lot smaller than I had expected and secondly items were missing. Now I trust my neighbour and the package was fully sealed, therefore I know my neighbour had not taken any items but my most expensive items were not delivered. I had received goods worth £55 and the remaining items were missing. I have called ASOS several items about this, I have contacted my bank and raised a dispute, however ASOS refused to give the money bank. I have also spoken to Citzen's advise and sent ASOS letters and emails with no reply. This company is the worst to order from, they claim they have closed my case and no one will speak/ answer me. I would highly recommend not ordering from them and I have never dealt with such an unprofessional, scam company in my entire life!

She apologised saying these things happen but refused to send my package back. Still waiting on a refund for my things!! I will never order from ASOS again.

            I ordered an item on the 12th April and received multiple emails informing me that my item had been despatched. I never received the item nor an email confirming that my parcel had been delivered. This morning I woke up to another email from ASOS claiming that they had received my item and my refund would be processed over the next 10 working days. Confused, I contacted customer services using live chat. I explained the situation to which the customer service representative responded “your order has been refunded and you will receive payment on the 21st April.”Again, I explained that I had not even received the parcel. Instead of apologising the representative merely explained that the delivery driver may have not been able to locate my address, which is utterly ridiculous considering my office is in a large building in central London with a 24 hour reception desk. I asked if the representative could resend me the dress to which she informed me she could not and I would have to go back through the website to do this. What a complete shambles. No apology, incompetent staff and a frustrated regular customer.

Asked a friend to collect the parcel though wasn't there and now trying to resolve this on email as I've no parcel and lost over £100. What a Joke!

            ASOS only cares about virtue signaling how inclusive they are yadi yadi, half of their non basics clothing is tailored towards non hetrosexual women and men.. that's just fine but to be sending out wrong sizes and have a customer service that's filled with robots.. It's a shambles of a company. I don't think the individual workers are at fault but it seems to me ASOS only cares about feelings of ppl visiting their website with their hyper inclusiveness instead of what their customers actually deserve. Avoid these amateurs.

            Brand-new to this brand, I received my package it had a hole in it. It was left outside for rain to fill. Opening the items, everything was wet, I literally had to turn the bike upside down in order to lose the excess water.  Contacted customer service, there wasn’t even an apology, more a fob off of just send the items back to us.   I’m shocked to read on here that so many disgruntled  customers are around .  Now I can see why based on what I had .

            Worst online retailer going.Ordered nearly £1,000 worth of clothes for a job interview, promised next day delivery.Delivery driver time wasn't convenient so I left him a note informing him of the time I would definately be home and a contact number.Delivery was attempted delivery and took note. Contacted dpd just after 3:30pm to be told that their depot was closed and they couldn't get my parcel out to me till at least Tuesday, which is no good.  Lost my 💩 with them given that it was a normal working day and delivery was quoted from 7am-10pm...Contacted Asos as a last resort, they did nothing and i ended up cancelling my order.Waste of   time and effort.Would never shop with them again as both times have been absolutely shocking!

            I ordered a white, button up dress for graduation and a silver disk necklace. I was incredibly excited to get these in the mail, considering I’ve always heard good things about ASOS clothing. I got it in the mail in a timely fashion and opened and tried everything on immediately. The necklace I ordered, came broken. There was absolutely no clasp attachment. The dress fit well, but it was completely see through. I’m incredibly disappointed in the quality for the price I paid ($45 for dress) ($10 for necklace). This company should be disappointed in sending customers this terrible quality of clothing. An absolute rip off. Never would recommend or buy from again. Save yourself the pain of returning it.

            I've ordered several times with ASOS and quality is great and delivery is usually on time. I have a wedding in a week and the stated guaranteed delivery date was before or on April 18, 2019. I repeatedly stated I need this dress for a wedding on April 27 and I only ordered it because of the guaranteed arrival date given. Beth was the one helping me and kept saying they'll look into AFTER May 8. I asked her several times to do me a favor and if it's possible to look into it now to see if it's possible that I'll get it before the event date which is April 27, if they look into it after May 8 I won't even need the dress!! I'm so upset and so dissappointed with the service I've recieved. She then ended the chat without letting me finish what I had to say. Poor, poor service.

            Awful, ASOS worked not just because of their range but customer service, but that is now slipping hard.I pay for next day delivery and they have clearly made changes to their supply chain because I've not received my order next day twice. The updates are shocking you used to get a text giving you an hour's slot now you have to be available 8-10pm. It's like going back 20 years! Then their customer support keeps telling you their system says it will be delivered next day, meaning they are either calling you a liar or dpd are misleading them. When you try to explain that, you literally get a computer says no response. Basically sit in all day on your Saturday and if it doesn't come, contact us. Wait for the crime to happy even if dpd have sent me written confirmation that it won't be delivered next day. Absolute joke, the failed delivery is one thing, incompetent staff is another.

            I am livid!I I shop on ASOS A LOT over the past years and I spend quite a bit for each order at a time. The past two years I feel like they have been going downhill. I received items extremely late, damaged items and incorrect items. This past order I return everything (due to receiving a wrong item and poor quality clothing) and shipped it out using their label. Mind you, whenever a company has provided me a label, I can typically email them and ask them for tracking info since they keep the return tracking number on file. Not for ASOS. I passed my package off to my mailman (so I did not receive a receipt) and three weeks later here I am waiting for a refund. I contacted them and they pretty much told me we need to see the receipt. My question to them, do you not keep track of the labels that you issue to your customers where you can pull it up? Their response, it's a free label, you need to get a receipt. Okayyyy. Well some people can't go to the post office and get a receipt. I asked to speak to a manager and they told me that they would say the same thing to me and ended the chat immediately. Safe to say, I am no longer shopping with them ever again and plan to shop with their competitors.

            I placed a order for next day delivery which did not arrive. In the morning I noticed that I didn’t have tracking details or email so I contacted support who told me it was out for delivery. In fact I spoke to them 3 times as I was concerned about the lack of tracking, all said it would be with me even though I told them I didn’t have confirmation or the tracking option. Of course, it didn’t arrive. So I contacted support at 10pm, that’s what the last person told me to do. All I received was saved responses that didn’t even make sense and that I had been sent from other agents earlier in the day. No offer of help or solution, I was told it’s due to arrive on 18th so to get in touch then. It is the 18th! Apparently I have to wait until 23:59 to report my order has not arrived! How ridiculous! One reply even said “I’m glad I could help” when my previous message said that she hadn’t event offered me any help at all. Lydia was the person on chat, she just wanted to get rid of me until after her shift had finished. I’m never ordering from ASOS again and I will tell everybody I know not to bother with them either.

            ASOS could be a very good company but they seriously need to work on their processing. I've paid for the premier delivery annual subscription which is supposed to mean your orders made before 12 o'clock is delivered the next day. I made an order on the 10/04 before midday, I was given the estimated delivery as the 11/04, a notification from DPD that it will be delivered. Then another saying it will be here on the 12th. A day after my daughter's birthday which the item was part of her gift. Today is the 18th. Guess what, it's still not here. No email was sent. When tracked the notification from DHL states that there was no delivery details. I contacted ASOS on their chat and was told the driver couldn't find my house despite living on a road with six other hours with my house number largely displayed on the wall. This never happens with any other company I use when using the same delivery service except when it's coming from ASOS. I'm not even sure what courier they use!!

            I’m so confused by the bad reviews! Have been using Asos for years and it has always been good and keeps getting better. I have had the odd issue-one or two late deliveries and twice when a wrong item has been sent BUT that is probably 1% of all the orders I have made. I order constantly and the app is so easy to use. Tracks my delivery. Returns are the easiest ever-even small things like resealable bags, tick boxes for returns, quick refunds etcThe variety of items is brilliant! It’s not often I can’t find what I want from self tan to river island jeans. Anyone would think I work for Asos lol But honestly, I don’t understand how anyone can have a problem with them unless I have been extremely lucky which I can’t imagine considering just how much I order.

            It says order before 12 for next day delivery. Did that and they took £160 of my money but the delivery won't be made until 2 days time. So a warning to everyone if you order at five to 12 expect not to get your orders. They told me it goes into a queuing system and even though I had an order confirmation before 12 to confirm my order had been received before midnight it won't be on a next day! Shocking. They've taken my money and now I'm not able to buy something else for my weekend away and I'm devastated. I asked if there was anything they could do to help me because it still hasn't been dispatched therefore it's been in there possession but they've taken my money and it was an outright NO and could be up to 7 days after returning til I can get my money back. Thanks for ruining my holiday with your faulse advertising. Please change the wording on your website to MUST ORDER BEFORE 11.55 FOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY.!

            Asos has always advertised their easy returns. That's a whole load of crap.I made a purchase of $220. Sent back 3 items (1 was a complete wrong order, 2 didn't fit and was ugly as heck), they did not even inform me that they received my return parcel or anything. 2 over months later, I contact them and stay said they received it a month ago, but are not refunding me because of their ""T&C"". I understood if they weren't refunding for the two ugly ones, since I supposedly had overlooked the T&C for the promotion I used. But they refused to refund for their mistake too, continuously citing ""T&C"". That's complete bs. I didn't get what I ordered. That should be grounds enough for a refund. But no. They phrase their sly T&C in a way that covers their a** when they make a mistake too. So now I lost my items, lost money, and completely lost faith in a company I've been supporting for 6 years now.If you're smart, you'd do the same. Absolutely trash aftercare.

            As a long-time customer, I didn't think twice about ordering almost monthly from them. Until I was sent a see-through maternity dress that  had apparent blood stain on the back and the wrong ring. I sent the package back, and I never got a refund. I was bluntly denied a refund after reaching out to customer service reps who just stopped talking and waited for me to leave the chat. So in the end, I not only did not get the items I wanted, I also had to pay for them. Other issues I had with ASOS latel include not getting confirmations and notifications via email and not getting packages on time despite my 2-day shipping yearly subscription. I guess I'll take my money elsewhere.

            I have had many small squabbles with Asos, because there is almost always a little problem with any order. But I looked past it because solving it would not be worth the effort it would take and because ultimately the prices so cheap.However, it has happened REGULARLY that they claim to not have received my returns, so you want to hang on to your receipts for dear life or you lose everything. In total, I have probably lost well over 300  pounds because Asos claimed they didn't get my returns.This time, however, was even worse; I ordered a few items for my upcoming vacation two weeks before my flight. I purposefully checked the tracking info and stayed in 2 days in a row, not leaving my flat, waiting for my parcel. Asos sent me emails 3 times claiming I was not in and they could not deliver the parcel, however, both I and my flatmates were in the house and we KNOW that a delivery truck probably didn't even pull up (we would have heard that).So I contact Customer Service and tell them the issue. By this point, 7 days have passed. They say they cannot redirect the order to be re-sent to me; it's their policy that after 3 ""failed"" delivery attempts, the order goes back to the warehouse and is processed as a return. I make sure to understand this correctly; they said I'd have to reorder all the items I wanted again in a different, separate order because the first parcel was definitely going to be processed as a return and I would receive my money back for that. To make sure, I did tell them I was not going to be in much longer as I was going on holiday and they said they understood and would not send me anything.(A side note here; the customer support person was incredibly rude and passive-aggressive. The lady later was nice, but still unhelpful.)Fast forward to today; 16 days after first placing the order,  it has reappeared and was delivered while I am on holiday. I am not going to be back for a month and when I tell Customer Support about the issue, they say there is nothing they can do and that if I want to return anything after I am back from my holiday, I would maybe get a gift voucher.I am incredibly upset because I did nothing wrong in this situation and Asos does absolutely not care. And they never do, so do yourselves a favour and shop somewhere else - Asos' prices are not worth the headache and in 80% of cases, you'll probably want to return stuff anyway; and that is where the real nightmare starts.

When i had to return something due to the size not fitting me, they refunded me.Excellent communication and customer service when i had questions regarding my order or availability of products.Dont mind the negative reviews as they most probably come from competitors who never shopped at asos.

            TOTAL SCAM! do not buy from them. I have returned some items and they refund me 0.64 dhs instead of their actual value (about 400 dhs) saying that the stuff i bought were under promotion voucher and now i am not eligible anymore so they will take the voucher back. so basically made me return the items for free!!! watch out from their terms and conditions, they make it sneaky so they rip you off. Also they never notified me when the items got hold off at the airport customs and i had to pay extra to get it. what a loss! soooo not worth it!

            TOTAL SCAM! ordered only 25USD and parcel was stopped at england. nobody told me it stopped . I needed to contact england by phone after searching the shipping company and then I they asked me to pay double the cost of the parcel itself. ridiculous. you arent supposed to pay if the parcel is less than 75$. and Even if you need to pay then you need to pay when it arrived at your country and not give your credit card to some unknown company that you dont trust. finally I got the parcel after paying and in israel they forced me to pay again!  4X the value in total+parcel value. and this is just for a small parcel.

            ordered on 3.4. was due to arrive 11.4. did not. since 12.4. I'm in an endless conversation with customer service which is a nightmare. no correlation between my questions and their answers. each time someone else writes who has no idea what his colleague wrote in a previous mail. i guess the item never left asos and it was all a hoax because it was a reduced item they never had in real. this was my last purchase attempt at asos.

            Appalling customer service. They claim free-returns and full refunds but once you try sending back an item, it's mission impossible! It must be very convenient to ask the buyer to request a ""return note"" online (instead of joining it to the delivery sheet like most businesses do!). You can try with dozens of browsers, you can try clearing your cache, you can try entering dozens of addresses (to locate your nearest drop-off point): you ALWAYS end up with an error message which prevents you from registering your return, hence from printing your return label and hence from obtaining a drop-off point. Very CONVENIENT, isn't it? Won't ever purchase from them again...

            I live in Hawaii and had subscribed to the Premier Delivery Service, which is unlimited 2-Day Shipping for 12 months. I only had the opportunity to take advantage of it for 1 month before they changed their shipping policy and decided it was okay not to let me know and took the Express Shipping option off my account, yet my account still states that I’m an active Premier Delivery member. I didn’t have a clue about any of this until I placed three orders recently thinking it would take 2-3 days after payment is processed to deliver as usual. Unfortunately, it’s been over a month and I still have not received my first order. When I requested a refund for my subscription they said I’ve already been member for a month so I’m not qualified for a refund. Mind you I’ve been a customer since 2015. It’s been frustrating for the past 3 days trying to get refunded. One response I received told me that I can get refunded and then when I replied ‘yes’, another rep says they can’t refund me. You are basically just chasing your own tail in a circle. These piece of sh*ts all send the same robotic replies and do not offer any kind of resolution. They obviously don’t care about customer service. Once they have your money, it will be very difficult to get it back even if they are at fault. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

            ASOS DESIGN products are always good quality and decently affordable. Whenever I order, it always came before expected. I’ve ordered about 10 products so far. Great range of brands as well. Regarding returns, steps are easy to follow and got my money back within a few days. Student discount could be more but I’m satisfied. Always got to ASOS for something before any other website. The app is also very user friendly. Better than other retailer apps by far. Just wish they alllowed product reviews on their app. 100% would recommend.

            Asos clothes themselves are usually good quality.... If and once they arrive. They use Hermes and / or Yodel for their deliveries which is a recipe for disaster. If you have an easy to find and access workplace, send it there and you might be fine. If you send it home and you can't  receive it when it arrives, good luck... I have has experiences with deliveries not arriving at all, arriving in unsafe locations or packages looking damaged. Yodel lets you 'choose' a safe location, but only from a dropdown menu, so it leaves very little room to play with if your safe place doesn't fit 6 or 7 options. It's a shame because the clothes themselves are usually decent and the range is really wide, but the hassle getting it there means it is simply not worth it.

I only ever purchased two items.. a pair of shoes for my hubby last year and a dress for myself last month.. the shoes arrived swiftly and perfectly and so did my dress.. the dress was beautiful but not nice on me so I returned it on the same day.. the money was back in my account in no time so I was thinking, happy days!! asos are brilliant! Then I received an email.. it was kind of like a warning about returning too many items and basically I felt uncomfortable after reading it.. my initial thoughts were, oh no.. I’m afraid to buy anything off them again now.. i’ll Feel pressured to keep it and not return it etc.  Just now I have read reviews from others who have had accounts cancelled for doing exactly what I have done.. so while my experience before that email and reading the reviews would have definitely earned them 5 stars without a doubt.. I now feel reluctant to buy from ASOS again.. 🥴

            I ordered a pair of shoes from them for my prom, and they came covered in dirt and scuff marks that would not come off. I contacted them through their website chat option, as I couldn't find a phone number (first red flag). The person on the chat told me that ASOS offers replacements, but not for items that come damaged (???? what else would need replacing?). He told me that I could send them back as a return and repurchase with the refund, but that there would be absolutely NO retribution for the item I paid for that came in unacceptably damaged. I asked if, since replacement was out of the question, I could get a discount on my next order, should I choose to purchase the shoes again, and he told me that I could sign up for their email list to receive monthly promotions. The man was perfectly friendly, but ASOS's customer service policies are unacceptable, especially considering the size and popularity of the company.

The day it was suppose to be delivered the courier tracking update said it was unable to deliver my parcel and to contact the sender as soon as possible. When I contacted asos they said they will rearrange the delivery to be delivered in two weeks. This meant it would be delivered after I moved country. I ask asos to just cancel my order and they said they would not be able to cancel my order as it was against their processes.

After that they sent the order again, and they kept pushing the deadline until it never arrived.

They say they’ve made the made this decision based on the fact that I have made a much higher than average number of returns and I won’t be able to place any further ASOS orders.  This is a joke. Last year I ordered about 4 dresses and I returned them because they were either poor quality or didn’t fit. I thought the whole idea of internet shopping was to enable customers to order and return if the item wasn’t suitable. I feel very insulted by this email and there is no way I will ever shop with ASOS again.  With retail in such a poor state as it is you would think they would be doing their very hardest to make their customers very happy.

            I’ve literally ordered and returned ONE ITEM in the last 1.5 YEARS. I received an email a couple of days ago from ASOS saying that my account has been deactivated because of “ongoing patterns of returns behavior that is against our policy.” I was stunned, surprised and completely confused since I’ve only ordered one thing from them recently. I used the chat option and then received an email from ‘Customer Care’ saying that they have made the decision due on the fact that I’ve made “higher than average number of returns.” I emailed them back and asked how can they explain that when I’ve only ordered and returned ONE item in the last year and a half? I received the same automated response back, but they also added “We will not be providing you with any more details with regards to this as your account has now been deactivated.  We reserve the right to close your account.” Um. What? I’ve never been so disappointed with a company and their lack of ‘customer care’. How they even came to that decision over ONE order (that was returned sooner than the return date and was never worn with tags still attached) is beyond me. How they can justify THEIR actions I’ll probably never know...

Now are 2 days that I'm chatting with the assistance because they dont have a Call center and she told me that probably I could receive my dressess on the 19 April because of a mistake due with their partners. Then, she stopped the conversation telling me to contact the delivery company even if it should be their duty not mine, because I paid for a service and I paid as well to receive the dressess within a specific date. Now my order is ""still on the way"", but I did this order because of an event. I dont know if I will be able to use that dressess for the occasion even if I paid for that. No words

I had a terrible experience and customer service was completely unable to offer solutions or rectify the problem. 2 Day shipping was actually 11 days, which is totally unacceptable. I had multiple events the items were ordered for and they didn't arrive until two days after said events. I had to scramble to find replacements. Customer Service could have offered to reissues and overnight the order when I contacted them the day after predicted arrival had past, but didn't bother. They just said we have to wait until the package arrives. Never again will I order from this company.

I did this ordered yesterday late morning and it arrived in the UK at 13.00pm what amazing service and super quick delivery! Next working day delivery and package was shipped with DHL from Germany!

            I used to LOVE Asos! They were my go to! Now their customer service is absolutely pitiful. They do not cover customs charges for certain items anymore, and they don't offer the free 2 day shipping for $19 a year. Last time I needed help, their online chat people had no interest in helping and kept ending the chat. They also deactivated my husbands account because he had ""unusual returns."" He hadn't even ordered from them in a year! And when he did, he only returned a couple things UNWORN WITH THE TAGS ATTACHED because they did not fit! When he emailed to ask about it, they again had no interest in looking into it further and re-activating his account. YOUR LOSS ASOS- YOU JUST LOST 2 MORE CUSTOMERS AND PROBABLY WON'T BE IN BUSINESS MUCH LONGER BECAUSE OF YOUR TERRIBLE WAY OF DOING IT!

            I placed an order number 397844277 with £196 which was eligible for your discount £30Then, I requested an exchange (sizing down) for the hoddie. They say they offer exchange. Now, for some reason, the hoddie (price tagged £65) was refunded as £35 which does not make any sense for two reasons.First, I requested an exchange and not a refund, the item is still available online and did not run out of the stock at any moment when I was contacting your customer care.Secondly, even if I requested a refund, I should be eligible for £20 off £125, which mean I would be refunded £55 and not £35.Bottom line, ASOS owes me either £20 or a size small of that hoddie and I want the hoddie.Also, for some reason, your customer care are trying to outsmart me and issue me a 2-day £30 discount code that only applicable on purchase of £175!!! This is ridiculous, it is not a big company manner, but a street dealers!!They are not replying my messages or e-mails. Now, I regret not checking their review rating, I can relate why now!!

            ASOS is a life saver for me... people talking about having accounts deactivated I don’t understand their frustrations as if they send all their orders back is fairly obvious they are not too keen on the brand and brands they stock. I buy from them all the time and send back stuff as required and have never had any issues...

            I have ordered and returned no more than 3 items (the quality of these items was horrendous and the sizing was off) and my account has been deactivated as a result due to ''unusual returns activity''. Their customer care have been extremely rude throughout and have refused to provide more details as to why my account has been deactivated ''because this account has now been deactivated'' (would love to understand the logic behind that). ASOS do offer free shipping and returns but you will be penalised if you return anything. This is an online retailer and as such people will intrinsically return items because they might look and fit different to pictures on the website - this returns policy is designed to coerce customers into keeping items they do not want to keep.

            I have shopped with ASOS for years, primarily attracted by their free returns policy which is crucial for online retailers. Today my account was suspended because my returns rate was “above average”. When I contacted customer services for further information they stated my account was suspended for “suspicious activity”. I very much resent the implication. I have always returned items within the time limits specified, not worn, with labels and in the original condition. Emailed ASOS to query this further. Their response: “we’ll not be providing further information about your account closer and premier delivery as our decision is final”. Meaning they have refused to refund me the £9.95 I paid for the premium delivery service I can no longer use.  Terrible service.

Their customer service is super speedy especially via Twitter and have never let me down.However!

            Today I have received an email telling me that ASOS no longer want my business and have suspended my account.  Charming.  According to the news I am the demographic they have failed to reach in sufficient numbers.  I am also the demographic that is likely to try items on and to return them if they are unflattering.  I do not subscribe to the wear once and discard principle so I do not buy continuously but when I do buy I am not looking for cheap clothing and I am prepared to pay more.  ASOS positively encourage you to make use of their returns service - it is plastered all over their website - and yet this is the reason I am given for them having suspended my account.   A little warning might have been polite!   I will continue to buy from Zara, H & M etc and will not give ASOS a second thought.

            Your old return policy was bad enough (ie short) and now the new one claims an extension to 45 days.. but during the extension period, you only get a 'gift card' for your returns. People are trying to buy clothing, not gift cards, and this is way too short a period to be not offering a full refund to your customers. There are plenty of places online to shop, so I'm surprised at your lack of generosity.

            Responsive and resolved my issue.Although Yodel lost my package or left it somewhere for someone to claim for themselves (I was never told what the outcome of ASOS' investigation with Yodel was), ASOS re-sent my order. Although some of the products were no longer available I still think ASOS were good at providing the customer with the best possible outcome. The instant chat function on their website is really good. They should stick to their previous delivery company, and stop paying Yodel immediately. I've only heard bad things about Yodel.

            I have had the worst service possible with this company. I placed an order March 19th, standard deliver, so I expected it to be at least 10 days.  We are now on day 20 and I still do not have any answer as to where my order is. I have been told to wait another 3 weeks and maybe it will show up because it was lost. I have asked for a refund which has been denied, the customer service teams just copy and paste the same answer over and over. I’m at a lost and not sure what to do now, I have contacted my credit card company to start a claim and that’s where I’m at now. The worst company to deal with in 2019!

            I've ordered from this website twice. The first time I received the wrong size. I wrote to Asos and they said they would send me the right size, but my replacement item was also the wrong size. The second time I ordered, I received the wrong color. I talked to someone at Asos and they said they would not look into the issue since their warehouse is too big to investigate. I didn't bother to order a replacement. Three out of three orders wrong is enough for me. Will never order from Asos again.

            I’ve used ASOS regularly for a few years now. I pay £9.95 per year for as many next day deliveries as I like, well worth the money. Have returned items with no difficulty. Using Klarna is handy as you can order different clothes sizes & return what you don’t want before you pay (30 days after placing order). I’m liking the variety of brands on offer in their beauty section too.

            Here's the problem. For every good experience (which I assume is because they've never had to return) there are a thousand more bad. And I've tried to give this place so many chances but they fail at every turn with their customer service. Here's what I have had to do in order to get my money back for returns that are usually due to their mistake. 1. Contact my bank to file fraud charges. I do this first because I already know I'm going to get a headache and no help. 2. I email customer service - and cc their CEO - Nick Beighton - his email is his first name. last initial at asos in case you need to email him.3.  I complain once a day until the either refund me promptly or my bank steps in to rectify the matter themselves. Customers should not have to chase down their refunds due to Asos mistake. Their customer service is abhorrent and needs a complete overall. Hell maybe their CEO should go as well because they obviously could care squat about their customers. Over it. I wanted to continue shopping here but the customer service alone has lost me. Good luck!

Why is this and can you switch them over please?ASOS[15:58:30] Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you.   Your chat reference is 18880266.[15:59:16] Hi Duncan, Thanks for getting in touch. I'm sorry to hear your item is wrong. Please bear with me for a few minutes whilst I have a look into this for you.Duncan Hewitt[15:59:55] it's odd because on the label and packaging it all matches up but the strip is the wrong colourASOS[16:01:52] So we can get this sorted for you, please return your item back to us within 28 days for free for a full refund or a replacement. If you want a replacement of the item, indicate this on the returns note and if the item is still in stock we’ll ship a replacement to you. If you want a refund or your item is out of stock,  we’ll refund you for the item and drop you an email to confirm. To find out more about how to return, and select your country from the 'return from' list. Please fill in the section on the back of your delivery note to say the item is incorrect and put the note in your parcel when you send it back. Do ask for proof of postage and ensure you keep it safe in case we need to look at it later on. Duncan Hewitt[16:02:36] Can you check if the correct item in stock? I don't want to send them back and then am told the item I'm after is out of stockASOS[16:02:51] I can, bear with me[16:03:48] I can see they are in stock but they are low, so I would recommend re ordering them and sending the wrong ones back to us for a refund.Duncan Hewitt[16:05:21] That is a lot of hassle.

You can wait for an exchangeDuncan Hewitt[16:08:49] Yes, but that is a risk. This is nowhere near good enough. Clearly it is not personally your fault but I expect to be treated better than this. Happy to talk to somebody more senior if so. I'm a loyal and regular customer. I've just spent £130 on clothes with you.

No, no, no. Please give me a way to contact a more senior member of staff? A decision maker. Otherwise, what is the point in having management?ASOS[16:18:26] As previously advised a manager won't be able to advise you differently, and they also don't work live chatsDuncan Hewitt[16:19:33] Read very carefully what I am saying, Alfie. It doesn't have to be on live chat. Give me a way to contact a member of management. I'm not going to be put off by you saying a manger won't be able to help me any differently. I still request to speak to one so please advise on how to do thisASOS[16:21:57] Our managers do not get back in contact with customers via email, Duncan. I'm sorry about this.

            TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service.I've ordered some things from Asos in the past, and they've always taken WEEKS to arrive without any confirmation numbers or tracking numbers.In my most recent order, I had purchased 3 items. One of the items was COMPLETELY incorrect. I had bough a medium size floral body suit... and the item that came was tiny tank top body suit (definitely a fraction of the price I paid for the floral body suit).I promptly returned the incorrect item with the return slip that came with the order. And have not heard back in 3 weeks...I chatted with a customer service rep, and she was completely useless. She wanted me to provide proof of postage and the item # of the incorrect item. How the f*** am I supposed to provide the item # of the incorrect item, when the item was INCORRECT?!?! The receipt had the CORRECT item listed... and I got some random piece of s*** in the mail...I asked the customer service rep, ""is there ANYTHING you can do for me in this situation? You guys sent me an incorrect item. And I followed all the return policies and procedures."" She straight up told me ""No. You are responsible for the item up until it's in our posession.""Truly awful experience, will never order from them again.DO NOT BUY FROM ASOS, the prices are not that great, and the quality is trash.

Then I wrote to the customer support and they didn´t answer at all. Later I wrote again and I got just a pre-built mail that the tracking says I got them and they can not help me. After I complained they BLOCKED and BANNED me in a really rude way. Never got such an impolite mail and it seemed more somebody with a really low level wrote it. I had to accept that my shoes were lost and ASOS didn´t want to help me at all. I accepted it, but in their opinion I was a liar. Two months later I found a refund on my credit card account - for the shoes. So it seems the shoes were somewhere at a post office in Budapest and as nobody picked them up they sent them back. It was clear visible that ASOS made this impolite and rude mistake with blocking and banning me - but still I got just a rude answer as I wrote them the story. When I try to order now again they cancel my order a few hours later. It seems they don´t need customers and with such a service such a shop should really fail...

            There is a reason this company has so few stars; it actually, truly and really sucks! I made a 400 euro order of 13 items and had it shipped for next day delivery. I had a job interview and was counting on some of the items fitting so that I could have something good to wear. I haven't been shopping lately, and I never bought from ASOS before, so I don't know how big or small their stuff runs. So I entered some data about my height, weight and body type into their (useless) AI and used their fit assistant to tell me what size to buy for my purchases. I was a trusting fool, let me tell you. I feel so stupid now. Everything I received was WAY to big. EVERYTHING (not to mention super crap-a-licious quality). I had to return ALL of the items (this costs 10 bucks) and I asked them to refund the 20 bucks I spent on the next day shipping. Reason being that I had trusted them that their fit assistant recommendations were of SOME use, but I ended up having to send back the ENTIRE 13 item order when not one item fit! I can understand that some things probably will not fit...but everything??? You can bet your bottom dollar that they didn't give a flying **, and just said that it is the customer's responsibility to order the right size and that they take no responsibility for their fit assistant. If you are a first time customer and you can't try on the darn clothes, how are you supposed to know how they fit?! You might foolishly trust their silly and deceitful AI! Why do they have that thing if it doesn't work AT ALL? This is a great way to lose a first time customer who was willing to dole out 400 bucks. I guess they have no interest in retaining customers. You would think that you can put some amount of faith in a large retailer like this. You can't. I wish that I had read reviews on Trustpilot first, I never should have ordered with them in the first place. Now I am just afraid that I won't get my refund. I ended up spending 30 euros to have nothing in the end. These guys are a pack of losers. Yeah, and I seriously had to improvise on that job interview outfit, things got a bit odd. A domino effect of frustration and travesty has occurred! ASOS, YOU SUCK! Feels good to write that...

            Won't be using ASOS in future since they've announced customers who return stuff are basically going to be banned and not refunded. Range began increasingly poor in terms of quality and fit, I would recommend taking pictures of a variety of body sizes to avoid returns and sort out the sizes. It's not the customer's fault. Completely disgusted at their returns policy and will be buying elsewhere from now on.

            I placed an order for DPD next day delivery, then received the email from DPD that it would be due the day after. Sure, I'm fine to wait for one more day though it's a next day service. Then when the day came, got no updates from DPD which shows that they haven't received the parcel from ASOS yet. Contacted the ASOS customer services who could do nothing but asked me to wait 48 hours for a reply. 48 hours passed, I contacted again and was asked to wait for another 24 hours. Finally received the reply saying that there was a problem with my order leaving the warehouse and they could not be able to locate it. They would send a replacement order which is expected to arrive tomorrow, but haven't received any updates from DPD yet. When I asked for any compensation for the Premier Delivery service that I paid for, the reply was really unsatisfactory and made me write this review. They write: ""As we've now sorted this for you, we're not able to offer any compensation - this is not something that we provided here at ASOS"".I want to say, this is not something you provide, this is something I paid and should be eligible for a refund. I was shocked by the irresponsible customer services who are unconscious of consumer rights.

            Absolutely terrible customer service! My delivery didn’t turn up next day as paid and requested for! I contacted them and was told that a calling card was left and they were unable to deliver as I wasn’t in. I can confirm I was in all day and I even left a safe place for them to leave the parcel if I wasn’t there! They clearly didn’t use that safe place (meaning they didn’t even bother to try and deliver). I then went onto their live chat which was absolutely appalling! One of them said to me ‘I’ve said all I can say so I’m closing the chat now, have a nice day’ I then tried a different way of contacting and making a complaint via Facebook and had a terrible experience there too! She constantly just kept using pre worded templates and said feedback will be passed on when I kept clearly stating I wanted to make an official complaint. I am not ordering with them ever again!

            ASOS delivery, returns and pricing are great. The reason I've knocked it down to three stars is because if you do have a problem and you need to get hold of them there is no phone line. Relying on social media contact methods is infuriating. I had some issues in the past with delivery charges and it took a long time to get sorted out and I dreaded getting in touch with them because I just wanted to speak to someone.

            Awful customer service - ordered two dresses which didn't arrive, despite the delivery person forging my signature to say that they had. DHL accepted liability as they couldnt say whether the dresses had or hadn't been delivered, ASOS said they would send a replacement. Fine. Two days later they get in touch to say sorry, dresses out of stock so have a refund (no mention of refunded delivery fee) even though one of the dresses is still available to buy online! Ridiculous doesn't cover it. Cheap clothing with super basic customer service.

            The item didn't arrive in the stated time. When I reported it, they asked me to wait another 10 day. I did, and they just asked me to wait some more. Finally when they actually decided to check, they tried to reship the item but it was out of stock. By that time I didn't want the item anyway. Eventually they decided to do a refund but they refunded me the wrong amount. I had to write in yet again to get the full amount. Dealing with them was a nightmare. I won't ever use asos again.

            So I knew ASOS had awful reviews before making an order, but I wanted to give them a chance anyway because I really liked the look of their clothes: I spent hours looking through the website and picking out clothes I wanted to get - and checked out with afterpay (which was also a struggle - you could only use afterpay on the app, and the app would not log me in, so it took me a few days to be able to login). Once I had my order, three days later I got an email saying that my order had been dispatched. I was so excited! Two days  after that I checked my emails again to see that they had cancelled my order and 'refunded' my afterpay - with no reason or explanation as to why. I honestly just let it go after reading the reviews of their customer service - could not be bothered to argue about it.

            Had the same exact experience as Emma Martyn below. Placed an order, was told it was shipped & the estimated arrival date, but received zero tracking information. When it was past the estimated date & I still hadn't heard any updates, I contacted customer care, who told me tracking numbers would be provided & I should expect to receive my order the following week. No tracking number was ever updated on the site (they didn't even update the arrival date on there).*That* estimated arrival date was 3 days ago, I reached out to customer care again today and was told that it was being sent back to the warehouse due to not being picked up from the access point. Which, again, I received no notification nor tracking detail to inform me that it had even arrived there. And instead of just sending me the items that I paid for and still want (including a pair of shoes that are no longer even on the website), I'm expected to get a refund by MAY (aka 2 months after initially purchasing) and should apparently try to buy the items again then. I think the most maddening point of this whole experience is how ASOS and its customer care team refuse to acknowledge any responsibility or take accountability despite the fact that I'm clearly not the only person this has happened to. Definitely won't be buying from them again, which is sad because other than this I've had little to no problems with them. As someone who's worked in retail I typically hate complaining online/publicly/at all, but man, this truly sucked.

            Last week I ordered clothes for a holiday in a weeks time - effectively leaving 2 weeks for delivery. I was meant to receive my order on Wednesday. Followed up today (a Saturday) to see where it was, only to find out it has been returned to the depot due to attempted delivery attempts. There was no card or phone call made to notify me of attempted delivery and I received two other deliveries this week with no issues. When I contacted their customer service I was told I could not  have my parcel returned to me and would be given credit on the gift card I used to purchase the clothes. This would be put on my account by the day before I go on holiday, therefore rendering this useless to me. I have asked for a refund on the gift card which again was refused. Not sure what the point of having an online business is if you are unable to receive the goods you order in a timely manner. I’m stuck with a £50 credit to be spent on goods I may or may not receive. Won’t be shopping with ASOS again.

            ASOS is complete s--t. I ordered a dress a month in advance for an event. The original delivery date was supposed to be 5 days before the event. (A month minus 5 days to ship from Georgia to California???) Then on the day the dress was supposed to come, I get my FIRST update from ASOS saying it won't be shipped until the next day and will take up to 2 weeks to arrive. ARE YOU JOKING?I ended up having to buy a second dress to wear to the event. I thought I would keep the ASOS dress because I still liked it, but when it arrived, IT HAD A HUGE HOLE IN IT. In order to get my refund, I had to drive it to a UPS store to ship it back to them.Waste of time. Terrible customer service. Avoid at all costs.

            I can see why Asos have a 1 star rating, their customer service is an absolute joke. If your order is picked correctly with no damage then its fine however you come across a small problem like I did then you are given lies and misleading advice.I was incorrectly refunded when I requested an exchange for a damaged item however they removed the £10 code I used which expected me to spend £80 and refunded me £3. I got in contact and expected to have been provided a new code to reorder the incorrect refund so this could be rectified. How wrong was i.It seems Asos create their own rules or their advisor's are just dumb. They gave me a new code of £10 but slapped on a £80 minimum spend on an item which which was refunded is £13. Got back in contact with them on Twitter and was given another £5 code which again is useless as this doesn't even cover the cost of the item I wanted and leaves me having to fork out for their error.After trying to explain this to them I seem to be getting thick advisor's who spin around the same template saying ""oh, stock levels must have been low"" NO THE ITEM WAS, AND STILL IS IN STOCK!"". I can see why they don't liaise over the phone, just imagine having to speak to people with this kind of idiocy over the phone. They would get eaten alive. I had one chat advisor saying she cannot assist me further and even gave me the ""your chat will be ended if you don't respond in 5 minutes"" because she was too stupid to resolve my simple query.Save yourself the hassle and don't order from Asos, I know I won't be anymore.

Last week (28 March, 2019), we found the bottom of shoe was broken with a big crack. She cannot wear this shoe in the raining day. I cannot believe the poor quality of the shoe purchased from ASOS, it happened within one month of purchase. I want to contact ASOS to complain, but found no contact phone or email on website. I can only post my complain here and hope ASOS can respond to the quality problem of our ordered shoe. Thanks.

            There should b a no star rating in my opinion.I used the $70 off $250 promo code and returned one of the items, ASOS received item however I was not refunded a cent!!!! I completely understand that with the promo code of course I would not get a full refund..  but not even a cent. What was the point of the return? I feel totally disgusted with them. I have emailed them several times and to only hear back from a different person every time and nothing has been solved. Their emails are just a repeat of each other. Absolute rubbish treatment BEWARE Do not buy from them unless you're certain of the product, ASOS refunds are a SCAM.

            I ordered a waistcoat for my dad for my wedding. I ordered a size 40 but when it arrived it was size 48. Sent it back and ordered a replacement. Decided they were the ones we wanted for the male members of our wedding party so ordered 3 more. When they arrived again they were the wrong size. Ordered size 44 and they were all size 48. Seems like they are trying to get rid of the 48’s!My wedding is only a few weeks away and my family live all over the country so things coming in the wrong size is really not helpful so I got in touch with customer services. Apparently I’m not the account holder because I used my dads card to pay for the items so they refused to speak to me about it. I explained the situation and that it is my account and I placed all the orders but still they wanted to speak to the account holder.This site is a joke. Can’t send the right size and make it very difficult to sort out a genuine complaint. Ridiculous

            Asos is a joke and a matter of time before they disappear. The service is a joke from them now and they are so far behind the likes of boohoo and other retailers. I made an order over 7 days ago and they have been delivery my items to the wrong address. I have emailed then over and over again that the delivery is not to me based on the description on tracking. They are like robots replying and not reading my emails. 3 days in a row they have delivered to the wrong address and they won't listen to me that it is not my address. The customer service agents are extremely rude via the live shat also. And now they won't refund me unless they get the items back even though they have confirmation from the courier to say they have returned the items to the depot. How is this possible.

            I spend a lot of money with Asos as there are some great bargains etc to be had. They’re happy to take your money but when something goes wrong, they literally couldn’t care less. Also as a next day premium delivery customer, their policy of sending items with different couriers to me seems ludicrous. What about their environment sustainability policy?! Hmmmm clearly money to be made, with no regard to their carbon footprint.

            There is no customer service.I tracked my delivery online until I was the next delivery, stood by the doorbell, and then the screen refreshed and just said that the driver couldn’t access my property. Contacted ASOS via chat and explained. The robotic Daniel said that nobody had been home to sign (despite me having already explained the situation). Clearly untrue. I was literally stood by the doorbell waiting because I was the next delivery on the online tracker. I asked Daniel to speak with the delivery company to find out why they said nobody home (maybe they have the wrong address?) - he refused. I asked Daniel to escalate to a manager or to their complaints team (maybe they have the authority to speak to the delivery company?) - he refused. Daniel told me that there is nobody else in the whole of ASOS that anything can EVER be escalated to or passed on to. Apparently nobody can ever speak to the delivery company to find out what’s happening either. Then when I repeated that it was false that nobody was home and asked again to escalate, Daniel changed the story from ‘nobody there to sign for it’ to ‘well, there might be lots of reasons why the driver couldn’t deliver’. I’m not sure what these reasons are, as the street is easy to access, with street parking, and the doorbell is right on the front and definitely working. But presumably, it might be a good idea to ask the driver before he or she attempts redelivery another day?So, absolutely useless, they couldn’t care less and they will not do anything to actually investigate beyond reading whatever the computer screen says. I’ve spent a lot with ASOS, but every time something goes wrong it’s a mess to speak with them. I think it’s time to kick my ASOS habit.

            I purchased two pairs of Assos bibs and over the last year and a half and the fabric has begun to thin out in areas where I could not use them. I emailed Assos and after several weeks they asked for pictures, receipts, etc.,  which I sent. I was then advised by Assos that  they were referring my problem to someone named Luca Zanasca, some hot shot, Instagram self-loving, bike dude rep in Europe. Well it's been quite a while and Zanasca never responded. Terrible customer support for a customer spending $170 per bibs. I am through with Assos, and advise others to seek other bib options if you wish a purchase to have good customer support

            I have had a really poor delivery experience with ASOS recently and have just live chatted with Sophie who wasn’t to helpful and if I’mHonest lacked the understanding of my case to be able to work with me to find the parcel. I appreciate that deliveries don’t always run smoothly however when a customer is willing to find the parcel and return it. After ASOS lost the original parcel and I am still working with them to try resolve. I have unfortunately after getting nowhere with Sophie written off the clothes. Sophie ended the chat with “as I have advised all I can I will end the chat”. Sophie still hadn’t answered the following questions for me: 1. Can I return the goods and get a refund 2. Which items were resent 3. What number was the parcel delivered too ( the correct number) Or actually got me to a resolution so I fail to see how she couldn’t advise me any more. She then told me not to ring DHL as they would redirect me back to them however as she lacked the understanding to help meJust told me to ring them, but why if they will redirect me?? And that’s the last bit of advice I got! Anyway long and short it’s pretty poor. I would recommend always getting your parcels delivered to click and collect which I had tried to do and then they resent it out to a homeAddress without my permission which has then resulted in all this. Let’s hope I find my parcel!

There is no reason I cannot cancel or alter my order within one hour of placing it. I have had this issue with lots of other major retailers who have been more than accommodating. Now, I have no way to retrieve my items and the customer service team has ultimately said you’re SOL. Never shopping here again.

            Absolutely horrendous customer service. I placed an order 03/26/2019 and paid for expedited shipping which was quoted for delivery on 03/28/2019. My bank account was charged on 03/27/2019. The package arrived on 04/01/2019 but the UPS delivery man would not release the package because it was shipped COD. I have already paid and the event I order the product for has already passed. Asos took no responsibility for communicating customs charges if incurred will be COD because they have statement about this on there help page. Why would I be on the help page when placing a simple order. If this is going to be their practice then it should be communicated during the check out process. In addition they are unwilling to compensate me for the  delayed delivery and embarrassment of having zero cash on me when the delivery arrived. So now I either wait up to 10 days for a refund or pay double the cost of my order product in customs fees.

I contact the shipping company of yours and they said they will bring me the parcel only on Sunday 7 of April.You guys are really not cool, not helpful, Didn’t tried to help with anything and make me a lot of suffering from those situations.I want all my money back and take back the express shipping.

            I figured I should share my experience with ASOS because their ratings seem to be low..anyways, this is my first time ordering from them. I purchased a pair of jeans. Overall, I love the jeans. They’re good quality and look like the picture. They fit perfectly as well (I used their fit guide quiz). My only complaint was that they look slightly different on me than the model, but that could be boiled down to height and body type. My order was estimated to arrive by April 3rd, and it actually came early on March 30th, which I was quite happy with because most people seem to be complaining about shipping. I did not pay the extra price for the express shipping, because in my experience, items never seem to arrive earlier, no matter the company.

            Order from ASOS a LOT and never have any issues. Questionable quality some times but for the most part I am happy with everything. Made a £150 order and received, as ordered, underwear with no hygiene label. I contacted customer service and was told that the item doesn't come with hygiene label. Little did the advisor know, I had already ordered them on a different account which came with a hygiene label. Advisor was blunt and unhelpful and this is a massive shame because I have been a loyal customer over the years and never once made a complaint.Now I am stuck with £15 worth of underwear that I can't return and don't want to wear in case somebody else has worn.

            Despicable joke of a company.US sizes are way off. They do not offer exchanges, only returns and then you have to reorder. They’re almost always out of stock of the item when you do reorder. If they’re not, they don’t honor the original price you paid. If it was on sale or discounted when you bought it, but it’s no longer on sale (or if you used a discount code), then you have to pay the higher price for the new items. I’ve never heard of any retailer doing this before. It’s a terrible business practice and is a scam considering the sizes are not correct. On top the their terrible policies, their customer support is completely unprofessional. They are rude, not helpful at all (they send a scripted answer to tell you they will look into it and then forward your request to someone else- why even bother having a chat line?), then they end the chat whenever they feel like it, without reaching a resolution or asking if you have additional questions. Stay away from this company and stick with brands that actually value their customers!!!

            Received a pair of leggings with a stain on them, was told to get a quote from the dry cleaners which asos would then refund me for, I took the leggings to be cleaned but they couldn’t get the stain out so didn’t charge me. I really liked the leggings and could live with the stain so asked for a partial refund (which most other places would do) but no, not asos. I told them that I wanted the leggings but they still instructed me to return them and wait for them to come back in stock to be sent a replacement, which they couldn’t guarantee. Apparently they can’t process a partial refund but they can process a returns refund... they have made this such an ordeal

            Will never shop there again. First, it took almost 3 weeks to ship to me. Secondly, I returned everything but 3 items in my order (almost $150 worth of clothes). They have yet to receive my shipment and are claiming the prepaid shipping label that THEY PROVIDED is not enough for proof of shipment. This is pretty much fraud because no one drops off a package and then asks for proof of postage. I have never had any issues with any other online retailers like this and i use alot. I'm convinced this is how they are covering their expenses by frauding customers out of money.UPDATE: I went to UPS to try to get ""proof of postage""... although proof of postage (according to UPS) is the tracking number located on the label that ASOS should have access to. Even when I asked their customer service reps to send me the city of their warehouse so I could narrow down some tracking numbers, they refused. Basically, they aren't incentivized to find the return because they rather take my money than keep me as a customer. They are withholding information from me which is by definition fraud: ""Fraud involves the false representation of facts, whether by intentionally withholding important information or providing false statements to another party for the specific purpose of gaining something that may not have been provided without the deception.""Never shopping there again as I am out $150 and will definitely be returning the other half of my order I was planning on keeping (another $150) due to my poor experience.

            WORST Customer Service EVER!Ordered some clothes.  They were too big so I sent them back.  They received the package and processed the refund - no problem!Re-purchased same clothes in smaller size, but received one incorrect item.  Sent it back JUST like I did the last package not a week before, at the same post office.  A month later, no replacement no item.Customer service REFUSES to even send the item I paid for.  I get why no refund without proof of shipping, but how about send me what I paid for!  If I had only received 3 items instead of 4, would you ask for proof is shipping? RIDICULOUS!!!I don't care how cute their clothes are...NEVER AGAIN!I am reporting them DIRECTLY to the US Federal Trade Commission!

            Was told my item will arrive in 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, I got notified that item is on the way, 1 week later the tracking website says the item has not moved. I contacted Asos and they said the shipment is lost and they can't find it. If I hadn't contacted them they would just ignore and not give any updates that it's missing.Giving 2 stars since they said they will issue a refund, still haven't seen my money back though.

            Asos used to sell good quality items and have excellent customer service. These days they sell disposable fashion with quality on par to Primark. With my most recent order I have received some shoes which are not the same as I ordered. Asos assure me the shoes are the same even though the colour and materials are different, the shoes delivered look like a poor quality copy. This seems a very strange customer service and shows what they actually think of their customers. I have completely lost any trust with Asos and would advise to avoid.

            I used to buy products from ASOS at least once a month- either for myself or partner.  I had an item due for next day delivery with DHL, but as this has now been over a week again (with the event it was needed for passed) it is safe to say I am unimpressed. After contacting ASOS with DHS’ ludacris replies, the summed up response of ASOS was ‘not our problem you’ll get it when it gets there’.Safe to say they’ve lost a good bit of business, I don’t have time for unreliable companies.

            HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Charged custom fees on my REPLACEMENT. They sent me a faulty swimsuit with an oil stain. Resent a new one no problem but then when I asked about why am I getting charged custom fees AGAIN and if they can reimburse these fees the most they can do is refund you once the replacement is sent back to them. They also have no phone customer service everything is online. The quality of my swimsuit is garbage. The swimsuit isn’t even swim material. Not worth the price I paid. Not impressed. Dhl the carrier service said they get complaints from customers all the time with packages from ASOS and asking to refuse the package because they don’t want to pay customs on replacement.

            I ordered clothing for around 50$. It took 2 weeks to even arrive to my country, but it turned out that it had a big fee (which I didn't know about) so I told the shipping company to send it back. ASOS told them to destroy the package. It's a scam and you won't get your money back, don't buy from this site.

            Don’t waste your time- the cute clothes are not worth the arrogant customer service. I had a cart full of items ready to buy, but came across a technical difficulty while checking out (website couldn’t connect to payment services). Used the live chat function to notify the ASOS team of the problem, but they proceeded to tell me that they have not been notified of any website issues. Am I not notifying you of an issue? They had me clear my Cache, download their app, and check my internet connection, all of which were functioning properly. Then basically told me tough luck, and that there was nothing they could do with the very problem that could have been potentially costing them tons of sales. Lazy much? Took my sale elsewhere, and will never be shopping here again. Would check ur team, ASOS. I would never want someone like that on mine.

            Purchased a leather jacket for my girlfriend for her birthday. After she unwrapped it we realized it was ripped. Contacted ASOS to exchange, but they had no more in her size, so they agreed to pay to have it repaired.  After searching for weeks to find a place that’d do it, we had it fixed and they refunded the cost, however, immediately after, it ripped again.  The jacket fits her correctly, it’s just made of the thinnest and cheapest leather I’ve ever put my hands on.  They refuse to allow us to return it now, as I’m done with this headache of a situation.  Terrible products. Avoid.

            The quality of their stock is terrible and they use terrible couriers. Their customer service is no help. You should expect that the clothes will be poor quality/badly fitting so don't get your hopes up. They are worth the risk if you want to order something with the off-chance that it will fit, as their returns are very smooth and easy.If you do order, I recommend ordering a few sizes if you want their own brand clothes. You never know how big/small/see-through/buttons-missing something will be until it arrives.I use next day deliver for a year for a one-off payment. This can be helpful for last minute events/gifts. But they will still sell those of you who don't have this next day delivery on busy days, and then customer service blames you for ordering on a busy day when it doesn't arrive (no exaggeration, this happened to me over the phone).All in all, after a few years of using them (and 2 1-year ASOS Premier subscriptions used), I will no longer be using them. I will be using quality retailers like Riess as they are actually better value and cheaper in the long-run.

            I hate to echo all the other reviews here, but the customer service is just plain bad. they have been somewhat upfront about delays and being ""super busy"" which is not my gripe. The customer service is literally worthless. I ordered a jumpsuit for my graduation to my old address by mistake, but luckily the local post initiated a ""return to sender"" OVER A MONTH AGO. Now I can understand delays within ASOS, but I don't see how that would affect the courier which operates completely independent of them. I have reached out at least four times about this order and NEVER get an answer beyond some scripted malarkey, like they never tell me anything that I don't already know. And actually I've had to tell THEM to track the package via the original number so they can see its on its way back to them. They are absolutely useless and inconsiderate. Any other company would acknowledge that I've waited long enough for an order I never even touched (there's proof of that in the tracking), and go ahead and issue the refund. This is absolute madness! Also, now that I think about it how are you ""too busy"" to fulfill orders when that's literally what your business does!

            I've been an ASOS customer for years, and despite quite a few issues cropping up I've remained loyal. I ordered a small item and paid a minimal amount for standard delivery, totalling around £12. I thought something was a bit odd as the ASOS order page didn't change to 'we've sent it!' as it normally does when an order has been dispatched. So on the day of delivery I contacted ASOS via their online chat facility and asked what was happening: the first guy I spoke to said the order had definitely been dispatched, and that I should just wait. There was a lot of cut-and-paste going on. The second person I spoke to gave me a tracking number for Hermes and said that, although there appeared to be some delay, the order would definitely arrive by the end of the day. Much later on that day the Hermes tracking app was still showing 'there's a delay...' and so I contacted ASOS again via the chat facility, and experienced one of the most blunt and rude customer service interactions I've ever had (mixed in with yet more cut-and-paste customer service spiel, the exact same spiel as earlier, word for word). I was told to go away in no uncertain terms, and so I put in a complaint via email to their customer services department.Overnight the Hermes tracking app updated to show the ASOS order supposedly left the depot, and then it went straight back to the depot a few hours later. It didn't even leave the vicinity of ASOS. This has actually happened before, about a year ago. So I tried to log on to see if the order info had changed in my ASOS account, and was met with a page stating that my account was blocked due to 'suspicious activity'. When I managed to speak to someone at ASOS about this I was told that my account was being closed and that if the parcel ever did show up at their depot then it would take a further 7-10 days to process a refund, and I might receive the money eventually. Of course I can't check on the refund because I no longer have access to my account. Being made out to be some sort of fraudster acting in a suspicious, illegal manner has been really upsetting for me. I'm still a bit gobsmacked that this has happened, as I've never come across anything like this before. The order was a small treat for myself because I've been really unwell lately, and it's turned into a complete debacle.I have never been so disappointed in a company. I just really hope that someone from their Head Office takes the time to look at all of these negative reviews - let's face it, we can't all be wrong! - and tries to change the way ASOS does things.

I was told to send them back and i would be refunded or could have an exchange once they recieved them back and investigated, i emailed to say my son was going away in 2 weeks needed these in a hurry and since this is second time its happened in a couple of months i wanted to put in a complaint, i got passed from pillar to post and was told to either wait for return to be handled, buy them again and ask for express delivery or use klarna, why the bloody hell should i have to do any of that when its asos whos at fault, they should have sent out the replacement as they were at fault, god sake man if you cant even pack a pair of bloody shoes right then theres something wrong, i dont know whats going on with these stores but they seriously need to work on their staff training and customer service, another retailer i will not be purchasing from again and iv been ordering at the very least £100 a month of products.UPDATESo we returned the incorrect pair of shoes with it clearly marked on returns note that we wanted an exchange for the correct pair, as mentioned and also told to asos my son goes on holiday soon, well what would you know they have gone and refunded the shoes and not sent an exchange even though the correct sliders have been in stock all along, didnt think they could actually get any worse, got onto chat to be told id have to order them again and they would maybe refund delivery charge, well no thankyou ASOS il spend my money on a retailer who can actually do their job. I will be very surprised if you are still in business this time next year, we lose the voucher scheme then the service just goes to s**t, i know i will not be entertaining asos ever again.UPDATE 2Trustpilot is around for everyone to leave their own honest opinion, if you have had a good experience with a company then thats amazing (do diddly do for you)  but it doesnt mean everyone has had the same experience so just concentrate on your own reviews rather than disputing what other people write.

            I ordered this dress for an upcoming ready.I paid for Express shipping and received it on time. It's beautiful and fit great BUT had a horrible smell of body order!!! The tie around the waist has come apart. The tag is also bent as if they just tucked it in to hide it.I contacted customer service to inform them that they sent me a previously worn dress. They did not apologize but simply informed me to return the dress and re-oder a new one! Unfortunately I do not have time since the wedding is this weekend! The policy return on their website states that if you'd like to return your items but don't wear them because they inspect all thier returns! Which is a lie because they totally dropped the ball on this dress. POOR QUALITY CONTROL AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! This was my first ASOS purchase and my last!!!

            I’m absolutely annoyed to be writing this review because I used to LOVE asos I’ve shopped with them for so so so long I’ve ALWAYS bought premier delivery since I can remember!! I had to return one order because I ordered two different sizes and returned an item (this got refunded 3 days later EXACT) I was also returning another order which didn’t fit my partner on the same date, I didn’t receive a refund or an email to say they’d recieved it so I left it around another week, still nothing. So I tried emailing in today from their website (I tried this three times) but their website wouldn’t submit the online form.. so I decided to use the live chat to find out what’s happening, I explained this to “RHYS” who said she/he couldn’t give me any info because my live chat email was an old email and my asos email was my current email, i explained this to her/him and that it wouldn’t let me sign out so it wouldn’t show an email so he could then let me get some info (doesn’t really make sense because I could still be anyone) and it wouldn’t let me change the chat email to my current and asked if he could then just email my current email which is linked to my asos account and I could then reply back so they know it’s me, she/he totally ignored that and just went crazy copy and pasting their scripts they use and saying he couldn’t email an email that isn’t on my account (so they basically ignored what I had said to them after I’d explained the email on my account is the one I want him to message and NOT the live chat one) anyway he also said that they could only give me info if I could sign out of live chat (which it doesn’t let me) which means that should go against their “rules” too I could be anyone or contact them on social media which anyone can make up a social media account or some don’t even hav social media! I explained that it’s private and I didn’t want to use it just to contact them and say the same stuff as I am now.. I also explained that I’ve had trouble before and that the person before literally just emailed my current email that’s linked to my account so I could reply there and prove ITS ME! I even sent over the proof of postage and still wasn’t willing to help me. They started saying they couldn’t send an email unless it was the one on the system and that they can’t help me further and closed the chat... so they basically just went against what I’d asked them to do and admitted in the end she/he could just email the email id asked her/him to email!!! So to get my money back I had to contact them on social media.. Now i thought my expectations from their customer service team couldn’t get any worse, oh I was so WRONG! Anyway! I contacted them explained EVERYTHING again, and sent over the screenshots to show the website wouldn’t let me send an email from there, sent the screenshots from useless RYHS to show id asked them to send an email to the email on the system and refused. And explained that I’m getting annoyed and shouldn’t have to use my social media, I mean there’s still a few people out their with the same name as me I still could be anyone so I’ve no idea what difference it made contacting them on social media than when I was on live chat! Just basically wasting my time.. so first I spoke to Paul! He literally read my message and I know he looked at the images because he located my order number from them, and asked me to give him my email that’s linked to the account in order to talk about my order for security reasons (whch i gave this to RHYS) and then said if I didn’t know this and needed changing to go change it in my settings I could. So I gave him it! I explained again that I didn’t need to change anything on my asos account and advised that the fault lies in live chat and explained the difference between both emails and which is on live chat and which is linked to my asos! So a little while later I got a message from Adam now and said he needed my my order number (which I explained earlier his colleague even quoted my order number as well as being in the screenshots I sent over) so this Adam didn’t read the previous chat OR look at the images. So to adam I explained this AGAIN and asked if one person could please deal with this so I can stop explaining I advised that everything is in the chat! Then last but least another person replied just to say they’ve now sent the information over to their specialist team and I have to wait for another 48 hours for a reply. So I literally went through all that today which RYHS could have just sent the information over to their specalist team at the start and they would then email the correct email! Just a joke and I’m done with asos, I’ll just miss some of their clothes. :)EDIT - Now I understand why asos have such bad reviews on trustpilot, their customer service team either need sacking or putting back into training, this is coming from someone who’s worked in marketing and customer service! I would’ve got sacked if I had their attitude towards their customers.

            Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Sent incorrect size, and then requested I ship the item back and wait 28 days for refund. Didn't offer any solutions, compensation or benefits, let alone correct size. Now shirt is out of stock and I have pajama pants with no top.

            I have been a loyal Asos customer for the past 6 years or so. The clothes selection is nice and that's why I go back HOWEVER, they probably have the worst customer service I ever had to deal with. The brand does not care at all about their customers satisfaction, helping you resolve issues, providing solutions. I just had a very annoying interaction with a customer service rep on the live chat, after providing no help and going back and forth for 50 mins, he closed the chat on me. Very frustrating.

            Ordered a pair of expensive Ralph Lauren shoes for my partner's 30th birthday. Firstly, they arrived in a damaged Ralph Lauren box and then when I checked the shoes themselves I found they were also scuffed and scratched. I got in contact first with the ASOS online team who said it must have happened in transit (highly doubtful) and secondly no apology but just to send them back for a refund. The person I dealt with was also very sarcastic & said I should wait for one of their summer promotions if I wanted a discount on the damaged shoes - I'm sorry, but why would they even sell them in that state to begin with?? I then decided to call them directly (I was told on the chat I was unlikely to be answered but luckily someone did). The girl I spoke to apologized and said it was obviously a warehouse mistake and wouldn't happen again... WELL, it was my mistake to believe this. Due to birthday time pressure, I ordered the shoes again despite having not yet been refunded for the first damaged pair yet... The ""new"" pair that arrived a few days later were even worse than the first!! There was no Ralph Lauren box this time, just a brown one with the shoes chucked in with some torn tissue paper. The shoes were in appalling scuffed condition and I noticed on one of the shoes it had a ripped off tag meaning they had blatantly been used before or already sent back to them. I called up immediately, again nothing they could do for this huge inconvenience except for me to send the shoes back again, meaning I have paid TWICE for damaged shoes. I've been refunded for one pair and now waiting for my refund on the second pair. In short, be very careful ordering from them, especially if it's a special gift. Terrible customer care & service. That's the last menswear order I'll be placing with them! Shocking.

            I am a long standing, loyal customer and this clearly means nothing to this company.I ordered £200 worth of items then received a call from the delivery driver to advise me that due to an incorrect mobile number, my order has been marked as fraudulent and will not be delivered.I ordered these items in plenty of time for my holiday and now any attempt to resolve the issue is being ignored.I even had someone end the chat on the help page. Surely the mobile number being wrong has no impact on the delivery or billing address which has not changed since I created my account many years ago!

            I ordered a dress for an event weeks in advance, Asos had a spend £50+ free standard delivery deal on so I assumed as I had over two weeks it'll arrive on time. Asos dispatched the item pretty fast and it was scanned into the trackable delivery system (Hermes), estimated for within 5days of dispatch, it didn't arrive. I attempted to contact Asos only finding ""live Chat"" so I spoke to a member of their team who just stated there has been a problem with the delivery company and it will arrive in two days time, she said she will update the tracking and I will receive an email stating this change, this I didn't receive (also checking my Junk folders) .Another week passed of waiting (as well as the event) so I decided I wanted to cancel the order, as I had purchased an alternative dress from another company, so I spoke to another member of their team via live chat and asked if it was possible to cancel the order as the event the dress was required for had passed, he stated: He understands and has passed it onto a specialist team that will contact me within 72 hours. I then received an email two days later saying they've refunded  the amount and it will appear 5-10days in my bank, it arrived the next day so I cannot fault them for this as its their chosen delivery company that are at fault. However, I would strongly prefer a number to call rather than live chat having my first live chat attempt fail and having absolutely zero outcome from it!

            Absolutely disappointed. I am a regular premier customer with asos. After today i am very disappointed! I have ordered two pair of heels. It was meant to arrive today. Waited indoors whole day just for the order to wear on occasion for tomorrow. However the stupid delivery driver has said his delievered the parcel when he hasnt. Called asos. They have opened a dispute and told me that it will take 24 hours for them to get back to me. They have no such thing as customer care satisfaction. How am i expected to pay next day delievery and not recieve my items on time. Out of order. They surely need to fix themselves and work with good delivery companies since they earn millions! I cant actually wait for 24 hours to be over and to hear from them. Because i am taking legal action!

            I ordered from them for the first time and how was i disappointed when i receive my order. One pair was to big, which understandable since i bought it online. But second pair wasn't even close to the pictures on the web site. I returned the items. And on the web site it says that i was suppose to receive my refund 14 business days after they receive the package. After 20 business days there was no refund. I tried to contact then through email - no response. After couple days i contacted them via chat, since there is no phone to call, and i receive it response that my case will be passed on to their specialist  and i will receive update in 72 hours. I will never buy from them again.

            I just ordered from ASOS for the first time and was so happy with the app and selection (and prices). When my order was about a week past the estimated delivery date, I came onto Trust Pilot to read some reviews and immediately started to panic. Normally I’d check reviews before buying but I knew ASOS has been around for a while, and since many Instagram influencers promote ASOS I didn’t see much reason to investigate until after the late delivery. Anyway, I went to customer service right away and they weren’t helpful at all. They had no way of tracking my package and couldn’t even tell me when it had left the UK. They basically just extended the delivery time and told me to contact them if I still hadn’t received my items after that date. I was very short with the rep and feel a bit bad about it now because the package did actually show up within a week after contacting them. I ordered two tops and a belt and love all 3 (all ASOS brand). The quality is good and they’re as pictured on the site. I will consider ordering again based on the fact that shipping and duties were free and I ended up happy with my items, but the delivery time and overall delivery system is substandard. I would definitely not order from ASOS if you’re banking on having the items in time for a specific occasion, unless you’re ordering months in advance.

            This company is a fraud. After over three weeks of not getting my order, I had to get into contact with 3 associates, none of which can be reached over the phone so it takes an excessive amount of time. Only to find out that apparently all three of the items I ordered were now out of stock. I guess they were just never going to tell me had I not reached out so many times. Apparently, my refund will occur in 5-7 days but I'm worried that they will even follow through with that after this horrible experience.  I explained to the associate, Adam,  that I would be writing negative reviews and he really did not seem to care, only stating that he'd be happy to pass the feedback along and that I could close the chat if I was done. Overall, AWFUL experience and I will never EVER order from here again.

Their customer support is rubbish they would reply on my emails with only 2 templates regardless your questions. Today I asked for a refund since my order was supposed to be here 11 days ago and despite the fact that I wrote 7 emails trying to explain that this is not ok, and if they have no control over the delivery time they should not give me an estimate. All their replies were about me allowing them some more time until I get my order wich is absurd. Do not spend your money on this company, time wasting and frustrating.

I ordered 4 items from ASOS on Wednesday afternoon, paying extra for next day delivery as I needed my clothes to come on Thursday because I need to wear them for Friday. I arrived home late after school on Thursday and checked my email to see that my order couldn’t be delivered as they was supposedly no one home. Firstly there were people at home and secondly I do not understand the reason WHY it couldn’t have been dropped to my neighbours as that was my second option on DPD for if there was nobody at home as they claimed. Yet they failed to do this.I tried to log into Asos and find what would happen to my parcels now and this was absolutely impossible to do. It said I had to pay extra £10 to resend my order which is a complete and utter disgusting cheat! I tried to contact Asos but it wouldn’t allow me and I had to deal with my order coming two days after the day I wanted it.THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AND SICKENING.

            I had ordered 2 products from asos (  the ordinary niacinamide + zinc and aha and bha peeling solution) on 22 January. It has been 15 March and my courier has been stuck in customs for more than a month due to incomplete documentation from the company. The courier company that has dealing with my order in India (Delhivery) asked me to fill form 12B ( this form is required for cosmetic clearance in India). And now my form has got rejected by the government site of India that deals with drug clearance stating that form 12B is applicable only for import of small quantity drugs for personal use prescribed by the doctor and not for cosmetic drugs.Really disappointed. I will not shop from asos again especially for ordering any cosmetics.

            PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!I spent over 1000$ in 2 weeks with this company and all good until one day they suddenly close my account when I ordered a GoPro, they did not even ask for more info about me in case it was a verification failure.Then, after hours of waiting to get a different reply from ""our specialist team will check"", they CHARGED my second account used for GoPro order, then blocked the account, and nobody knows anything about the status of the order which probably will never come.

            I made an order during the promotion: 25% discount for orders from 13000 RUB Asos messed up one thing in order. I wanted her back. But Asos writes: the terms of the action violated. I have to return the whole order. If I return one wrong thing, Asos will recalculate the order amount. I will effect the cost of the order without the discount of 25%. This is the first time I've seen such terrible service. Why should I pay for the store's mistakes. I will never buy in this store and do not advise anyone!

            Oh my. Where do I start? I’ve used plenty of online shopping websites and this is one of the worst I’ve ever experienced, even compared to China websites. ASOS has been by far getting worse and worse in delivery issues, customer service and quality. Trust me and save your money and a headache. This has been numerous times that I’ve given them a chance and ordered an item which was not delivered and they tell me to knock door to door to ask my neighbors if they’ve received it or to check with the post office. Once my order was 2 months late and they finally found out it wasn’t even shipped because it stayed at the warehouse and they had charged my account.

            I was a little hesitant to use this company but everything has gone very smoothly. I bought a lot of clothes for $200. The quality is good! I really like a couple of the items!

            Ordered couple of items, later on checked and found out that the address to be delivered is completely different from what I put as a delivery address. I live in LA and there is no chance I order items to be delivered to Delaware, where I haven’t been in my life. There wasn’t tracking number with the order summary.  Contacted their customer service vie online chat, the lady told me that the items are dispatched and  they can do nothing. She instead of trying to resolve the issue, which apparently was a glitch of their website, I got a long training on how to buy items in the FUTURE. No practical ideas how to resolve the current one, yet I got a very extensive  training from an ASOS  rep on future orders. To all my explanations that The rep also lied to me, she told me that the items are dispatched (was March 10)and nothing they can do about it. She could not provide me with a tracking number though,  yet in 3  days (March 13) I got an automated message that the items are dispatched and will be delivered in 7 days and they provided me with a tracking number. I checked the number it really was dispatched on March 13 and to be delivered to a Delaware. She basically was lying the whole time, that items are dispatched. She refused to provide any phone number so I can contact ASOS and talk directly, so we aren’t  back and force through messenger, she also refused to escalate the issue to any supervisor. she was just having fun of me. The only feeling I got from the 1 hour e-conversation with her was that she is having fun of me, never experienced that, HORRIBLE FEELING THAT SOMEBODY IS JUST HAVING FUN OF YOU. At the end she ended the conversation, as I contacted them to sell an insurance.

            Worst experience ever with ASOS , send a wrong item to me, take the trouble to send back to them , was inform that refund have been made , check no refund receive after 2 months of waiting, wrote in to check and a different story was given. Refund cant be made and given a promo code with a minimum spending of 100 pounds. Why do I need to have a promocode with a minimum spending when the mistake is by ASOS , not acknowledging their mistake but brush off the customer with a ridiculous reasons and waiting time, worst ever retail online experience , never ever return your stuff to them even it is a wrong item receive cause you will never ever receive any refund .

            Great selection of clothes and fast delivery times, but if you ever need to contact them for help then just don’t bother. Had my first issue in November 2016 where my parcel was never delivered, just sent back to ASOS and refunded. Messaged them - this got ignored.Called them, waited 45 minutes on the line and then the agent answered and hung up.Never bothered contacting them again.Next issue January 19th I ordered 14 dresses totalling £411 as they were on sale and I wanted to pick 2 for weddings I had throughout the year.Package arrived with only 6 dresses inside. Called DPD who asked if the parcel looked damaged. It did, it had DPD tape on it.He advised me to contact ASOS so they could open an investigation.Contacted Asos at least 6 times over the space of nearly a month. I always had to chase them for an update after their promised times. I couldn’t understand why I was left out of pocket for dresses that they had lost. This should be dealt with between ASOS and the delivery company, having no customer impact.I was left £411 out of pocket for 3.5 weeks as they “couldn’t do anything until the investigation with DPD was concluded”.After me hounding then again, they just refunded the money for the missing dresses.I then received an email after the refund as procsssed to say that they checked stock for the missing dresses and don’t have any of them in my size anymore. THEY HAD LISTED THE WRONG DRESSES. I checked myself and some of the dresses were in stock.I explained this to an agent over email twice who replied with the exact same answer and the exact same list of dresses. I asked to complain to which I was told “we don’t have a complaints process or managers”. I replied again that this was ludicrous and I got no response and my case was shut down.It’s now the 14th of March and I am STILL waiting on my refund of the other dresses which I returned. Still £116 out of pocket due to their incompetence.Their customer service is one of the worst I’ve seen so just hope everything goes right with your order!

            I've made 2 orders on 9th and 12th February. They shipped 13th February. The estimated delivery dates were 28th February and 1th March. But i recieved them only 14th March. The costumer service is bad, because they don't correctly answer your questions in particular where is the orders, because they don't have the tracking information. But in orders information they were! My orders came directly what i ordered, but the lack of tracking information and customer service inspired me to put 4 stars. P.S.

            I ordered 2 items over e200 to get a special offer of e50 off... it's the only reason I ordered the 2 items.When they came in, one of the items was a little small.  So when I returned and purchased the other size, I was only refunded the value of the item, minus the e50.Upon contacting customer care, I basically got the same excuse 5 different ways... not sure if it's a machine that churns out the responses coz a person should be able to apply common sense añd logic, to know that I should be refunded the full value of the item. The unfortunate thing is that I was lining up to purchase more items from the store but now after this, for the sake of e50 ... they will lose sales from me of €€€, that's why their customer care is useless.

            I’ll start by saying I’ve used ASOS for a few years now. Things are usually delivered correctly and refunds processed quickly. However, my last order was a complete mess - the initial fault lies with the delivery company who I’ve also expressed my views about. I’ve paid for premier delivery so it’s next day delivery. I ordered three days before my holiday. I received an email saying my clothes (holiday clothes) we’re ready for collection. Upon attempting to collect I was told the system was down and to try tomorrow. The next day I was told my package was lost and would take 2-3 business days to find. ASOS were aware of this failure immediately but failed to act. Failed to try sending again. Failed to give me answers. Failed to get back to me since. I had to go on a nice holiday with old rubbish clothes. I’ve now sent multiple emails requesting a refund but my emails are being ignored. This seems to be a recurring problem with their customers. Better using Primark - same quality of clothes.

            Their customer service is appalling. I pay for next day delivery yet every time they use Hermes to send my deliveries, they don't come the next day due to Hermes' horrific service. Asos' customer service don't do anything about it and say to wait until the next day. If I have paid for next day delivery, it is down to them to make sure I get my parcels the next day, but instead take no responsibility. No wonder their company is failing massively and they always have to throw everything out on sale. Can't see Asos still being a thing this time next year.

            By far, the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. I was always suspicious about asos and never liked it's aesthetic but I saw some cute tops and I said to myself ""why not try it, worst case scenario I will return the things I don't like, just like any other online shop, right?"". Well, nuh-huh! The clothes were so much different than the photos, very poorly made and totally different colours. Their customer service is non existent. In case you want to return something, well you better pray to Jesus, or Krishna, or Kukulkan, or any other omnipotent being humanity has ever worshiped, to get your refund. I have returned my order since the 14th of February and contacted them twice regarding the parcel's whereabouts, but I never got a clear answer. All their employees told me to wait another week and if the parcel got lost it is my responsibility for choosing the returns method suggested by their site.So, long story short, I just got scammed out of my money. This company is awful and I hope it crumbles to the ground along with its rude and bad mannered employees :)

            ASOS website is very good, easy to use and ordering my products was straightforward. The issues was with the delivery - ASOS uses the courier Yodel. I paid extra for a shorter delivery and my delivery information stated my order would arrive in two days (a Saturday) which was great as I needed the products by Sunday to showcase them to the bride of the wedding I am part of. However, when tracking my delivery despite the ASOS tracking saying Saturday, Yodel tracking said Monday. Obviously, the parcel was not delivered Saturday. On Monday whilst out, I received a message from Yodel saying my delivery was left in a 'safe' place, but when I arrived home it was left in plain site at my front door. This isn't safe at all and anyone could pick it up! Despite this I am happy with the products even though I will have to now wait to visit the bride when we are both free again.

            Appalling ‘non-existant’ customer service. An absolute joke.I ordered a ski suit on a next day so I had enough time receive my order and try the fit before my ski holiday.I received a Tall fur collar denim jacket costing £24. How? More shocking was ASOS resolution to their mistake....I contacted ‘customer service’. To be told to send a £24 item back before I can receive my £192 item.. taking up to 28 days to process. *I needed my ordered item to be sent straight away on a next day.I even suggested I take the incorrect item to the post office and email proof of posting. ORPay the £24 for the incorrect item ..and then send that item back for a refund, with my correct item being sent to me ASAP on a next day.I was told  to place another order for the item I should have received and pay another £192, so £384 in total - for Asos’ £24 mistake. An absolute joke.I order a lot online, ASOS are by far the worst service I have dealt with. Save your money and buy elsewhere.

            I have bought a Missguided dress from ASOS size UK6/US2. Their site also recommended me this size according to my measurements.When I received the dress I wasn't able to zip it up.It was very small and the fabric had no stretch.When I contacted their customer service the only answer I got that I have to return the dress to get refunded.The only problem is that Canad post has very high shipping costs abroad so it's not worth for me to pay so much for the shipping.They couldn't care less about this problem and didn't offer me any discounts  or partial refunds.This was my last time of buying from this site.

            This company offers very good products however the service side lets this down significantly especially since they have started using DPD delivery company which always result in delays of parcels and are unprofessional this collaboration or partnership brings down the name of this company and they should look at getting a different career or delivery company to deal with part of their service. So many times this company has left the parcel in front of the door despite telling them to leave it in a safe place and so many times have parcels gone missing as a result of this when it comes to trying to deal with ASOS and getting a refund from them it often feels like pulling teeth and I have to use a alternative consumer conflict resolution company in order to get them to respond adequately because when you are launching a complaint different people  deal with the same complaint in the same department  so you often find yourself repeating yourself over and over again but the majority of the complaints stem from the delivery issues and they can fix this and become a good company if they news a company that has a lot more reliability and integrity

            So...I'm part of a wedding party and there was some blazer I had to order from Asos. Unfortunately, the blazer (by Noose & Monkey) had a few noticeable marks on the right and left shoulders, so I started to the return / exchange process. First off I was surprised that I had to pay for return shipping, but I was told it would be reimbursed after reviewing the item (so no biggie), but it definitely wasn't clear on their ReBOUND return site (Asos partners/works with I guess). Secondly, I could only find digital communications to deal with them (live chat, email, etc) but no phone, which made the whole process challenging expressing the problem and providing clear options. In comparison to other companies like amazon, zara, etc. (which are great) I found the return process is absolutely atrocious with Asos. I then find out there's none of the item left in my size (i.e. screwed for the wedding), so I'm then stuck with the defects and meanwhile I already kicked off the shipping label return process and paid for the shipping. Given the situation, I conceded and asked for them just to refund the return shipping costs which I didn't utilize / render the services and they were unable to refund the return shipping costs unless I sent the garment in, which wasn't an option given I need to secure for the wedding. Escalated and disputed the charge with Visa to deal with their shenanigans, which based on the ReBOUND terms of conditions and Asos', they're in the wrong. Last time I'll ever purchase anything from them.

            I contacted Asos 16 working days ago, and enquired about a parcel they stated was delivered, it has been 16 working days and they have no resolved my issue. Instead, they have asked me to wait 24-48 hours after sending over 70 emails, twitter DM's, Facebook DM's and Instagram DM's. 24-48 hours equals 16 working days every time I ask them to sort this out they tell me to wait 24-48 hours. I have asked them to sort this out, to send me the order I paid £180 for!They still have my £180 and have not sent me my items! I have requested a refund and they are refusing to do so! Stay away from ASOS they are thieves and their customer service if you can even call it that is disgusting, They ignored you for days and when they do respond to you they quote the incorrect order number/name/address breach of GDPR? I've been called so many different names, it's embarrassing. They do not care about any of their customers!

            Purchased a pair of Nikes on February 27, 2019 and paid the extra eight dollars for ""express"" shipping. Receipt said item would arrive ""on or before Tuesday March 5."" I needed these before Saturday, March 10. Needless to say they did not arrive when they were supposed to. They will not be here(California) until March 18. Customer service allegedly refunded me my eight dollars. Currently my item is sitting in Indianapolis, where it's been for three days now. Left warehouse in Georgia, two days later it was in Indianapolis. God knows when it will leave there. Don't be fooled by the top location link on Google. This is not a reputable company. From reading all the other one star reviews, it looks like I'll be lucky if I get the item, or eventually get my money back in the form of a refund because the shoes never arrived.

Have never been so infuriated with a company and their customer service skills. dress did not come in on 3/1 as promised so I contacted them for a refund, they said if it’s not in by 3/5 contact them for a refund, I did. They said they cannot refund because it’s on it’s way and will be there by 3/15. They sent me a tracking number which brings me to a page that’s says delivery date has not yet been determined. I’m just so mind blown. I feel bad because I used to really like  this company, but something is going on and they have my money and I have yet to see any merchandise. Also even if I do receive and send it back I probably won’t see a refund for a very long time. Have lost all faith on this company. GET IT TOGETHER!!!

First I ordered GFN-Good for nothing jacket that was complete crap, in 3 hours of wearing on both sleeves the jacket torn. I sent the jacket back but had to buy for 5 euro print of the return label and a bag for the jacket. 2 days ago next order came, ordered 2 shirts and they sent me the wrong one, all different from the picture, now I have to buy again the print of return label and the worst thing is losing the time again because they are horrible. They should have sent me that 10euro shirt for free if they are that stupid to send the wrong one, I hate losing time on things like that. And also if something is crap, don't sell it!!

            THE 3 BIG PROBLEMS WITH ASOS1. ""New"" means that the item has never been worn, tried on, in the original manufacturer's packaging.* Not to ASOS it doesn't. They will regularly send items that smell of dry cleaning chemicals. The fabric won't feel new and soft due to the treatment of items returned and then passed on to unsuspecting shoppers as new. They regularly ship items that appear to be in their original manufacturer's plastic shipping bag.. BUT they are generic shipping bags with a generic label that gives off the appearance that the item is new when in reality it's not. *When you reach out to ASOS customer service through their useless ""help"" chat tool option, you will encounter everything but the help you would have hoped for. You will encounter rudeness, denial, frustration, and cut and paste answers that have little to nothing to do with the questions you ask.*DON'T bother asking for a supervisor because they ""are all trained at the same level and floor supervisors don't take on the types of concerns that you've reached out to us for help with today"" is the garbage they feed you. *DON'T expect them to furnish corporate contact information of any kind. ASOS customer service is a firewall that cuts you off, shuts you up, and leaves you wondering why the hell you ever did business with them in the first place!!!Problem with ASOS #2The yearly subscription fee for of $19.00 for ""2 day expedited Service"" is a scam! I ordered a pair of adidas superstar track pants on the 2nd of March and they just now (7th of March) sent an email advising that my item has been ""Despatched"" 5DAYS AFTER MY PURCHASE WAS MADE! Delivery is expected on the 12th.. THE 12TH!!!! 10 DAYS AFTER MY PURCHASE WAS MADE!*Buying shoes from ASOS? Good luck with that! if you like storing your kicks in the original shoe box, that won't be the case with shoes you purchase from ASOS. They ship their shoes in a soft shipping bag which causes the weight of other shipments loaded in the logistic containers to smash the box to the point that when you finally get the shoes delivered and you see the shape of the bag as the delivery man is handing it to you, you instantly get a sick sensation in your stomach and perhaps throw up in your mouth a bit. Don't bother contacting them. To ASOS, the shoe box is a vessel that keeps the shoe safe and not a reason to return the item for a refund. IN SHORT.. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW HARD YOU WORK TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE ITEM YOU PAID FOR. I BET IF THE ""SHOE"" WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT AND THEY RECEIVED AND ENTIRE PALLET FULL OF SHOES AND ALL THE BOXES WERE SMASHED (BUT THE SHOES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE) THEY WOULD COMPLAIN TO THEIR SUPPLIER AND DEMAND REPLACEMENTS, DISCOUNTS, OR WOULD SIMPLY REFUSE AND RETURN THEM TO THE VENDOR THAT SOLD THEM THOSE SHOES. Just a hunch..  Problem with ASOS #3Well.. a quick recap on the first 2 problems:1. ASOS passes off returned items that are chemically treated as new to unsuspecting customers by placing the items in a generic shipping bags with a white thermo label that gives off the appearance of new..  but aren't. 2. 2DAY expedited yearly subscription fee of $19.00 is a scam. There are unacceptable delays and don't bother asking why because they will just ask that you refer to the prompt advising that there will be delays. They never advise when the delays are expected to no longer be the case. They don't advise what they are doing to fix their internal ball dropping which is the actual reason for the delays to begin with. But they sure as hell take that $19.00 fee and tell you to go kick rocks when you point out that they are guilty of false advertisement and Dishonest business practices.and finally #3ASOS returns are free. ok? It takes 10 business days for them to receive your return (so they say). I returned a defective item with the stench of perfume, and no price tag with with their return label which is found in the shipping bag your items are shipped in. It takes on an average 12-15 business days to get your refund back from them. A refund for item's that 7/10 times should have never been shipped to you in the first place. They bank on the careless shopper that doesn't know any better.. I HOPE THIS HELPS!!!

            Shipping is taking forever. I was supposed to have received my stuff by now but it's now been pushed back by a month. The date of delivery keeps changing when I check the service updates. I'd heard of ASOS before and hadn't read the shipping reviews, but I seriously wish I had. Only reason I'm not getting a refund is because I don't fit into a lot of clothing where I live and I'm forced to shop online for most of my clothing. Come on, ASOS. Do better.

            Avoid if you can yes it's cheap but quality is rubbish . I bought a pair of £40 joggers only for them to have a hole in them so sent them back . Finally after waiting 2 months they had my size in stock again so I ordered them again only to find that they stitched the hole up (really badly) and re sold them to me .

            Absolutely appalling. I was supposed to have received my items 2 weeks ago, and have received nothing. I reached out to them via their online chat to be advised I have to wait another 3 weeks until they will consider looking into it. Then this will take another 5-10 to refund if eligible. 2 people on the chat disconnected when I asked further questions. Purely a scripted chat that does not cater to any sort of customer service. Will not use again. Wish I would have read the other reviews before buying.

            Ordered 3 things and ended up getting free shipping. filled my info, including my address and i expected to get the package at least in the town, where I live. Opposite from that, they shipped it over 40 km away from me to the postboxes, near the airport and simply left it there. I don't understand then why they need the info where I live if they don't use it??? I would recommend to find another shipping company that would be more efficient.

            I was the biggest fan of ASOS, I even worked there years ago. It's a shame to see that it's gone to seed,I pay for Premier, I should get next day delivery, 6 days later I was still waiting.I checked the tracking every day, and saw that it was out for delivery, but every evenings the tracking said it would be delviered the following day.The ASOS customer service team were really unhelpful, failed to answer even the simplest question (why is the parcel delayed?) and instead just kept telling me what the tracking update said. Obviously could not be bothered to deal with any customer enquiry first hand.After 6 days, I told them I was no longer interested in receiving the items, they were too late, I was told then that it would take up to two weeks for the return and another 2 weeks to get my refund, so ASOS just have hold of my money for up to 6 weeks now.All in all, terrible delivery, unhelpful customer service, waste of time.I've since asked to close my account, they haven't even bothered to respond to me.

            I have never had problems with ASOS in the past, shipping was always on time even without selecting 2-day shipping it was quite speedy. Recently I have also fallen victim to this two-day shipping scam that everyone else on trustpilot has been complaining about. I had ordered some items on the 1st of March for my trip since i'm leaving town early in the morning on the 8th. At first I was disappointed since I knew the clothes I would order probably couldn't reach my house in time for my trip but then I thought there was some hope at the end of the tunnel when I saw their option for two day shipping. I was willing to spend $7.99 just to make sure I'd get it on time. The package took THREE full days to even ship out. ASOS's estimated delivery was on the 6th yet I doubt it will arrive tomorrow based on Fedex's estimated delivery on March 11th. This is unacceptable for ASOS and the site has definitely lost my trust from now on.The first costumer service person I contacted was absent for a total of 14 minutes of going between them ""typing"" or just complete silence. Their final solution was a generic copy-pasted ""we are busier than usual, sorry"" type response. The second costumer service person was a bit nicer and offered more solutions and even gave me a discount code for the trouble.

            First order with them was great, but second order is where things went wrong.  They had increased their US time-frame for shipping to add another week, so I was going to have to wait twice the time than my first order.  They let me know that up front so no huge deal.  Two weeks for shipping still seemed a bit long.  But then my order did not even ship out until the day it was supposed to arrive.  There was not communication for this and having to wait 2.5 weeks for one item is ridiculous.  And naturally nothing they could offer to make up for the incident.

There is no-one to speak to, they wont give me my money back and I still do not have my order. The ""chat"" support is a joke. They have pre-typed answers they just automatically respond with, without actually trying to help in the least bit. (The answer to everything is"" please bear with me whilst I look into this for you"" and the only resolution they offer is  ""Rest assured your order will be with you very soon"".)I am absolutely disgusted.

            ASOS is a great place to shop until you have a problem arise. I've now had two different major issues. The first being a package that arrived late and destroyed and the ASOS team would not refund me any money. The second was a package that was supposed to arrive within the 2 day shipping I paid for but was delayed by another three days. The ASOS team refused to do anything to remedy the situation and told me I could only receive help once it was fully past the delivery window even though UPS tracking showed it wouldn't be arriving in time. Moral of the story: Don't ever rely on ASOS to have pieces for special events or by a specific day. Plus, keep your cart values low so that if an issue happens with a package you don't lose out on a ton of money.

            Awful awful awful service. Used to get my items in 3-4 days max when it was coming from the UK. I’ve been waiting over 3 weeks for this last order I placed and ASOS just keeps telling me to hold out a little longer. It’s a $400 order of maternity clothes and honestly the baby will probably be here before the order. I plan on returning everything just on the basis of how many times I’ve been lied to and rudely dealt with this time around. Absolutely appalling. Will never use ASOS again, ever.

            As you can see below - customer services is terrible. It is the same response over and over again as they do not have power to do anything.Delivery was supposed to be express - however it takes them even longer than the standard shipping to deliver the item. If you want your items - may want to be aware that it may come 1 month or 2 months after your order.Unacceptable service from a business that has been around for a while.

            Like many people I have been shopping with ASOS for years. However, my last few orders have been the worst experience. I too have the 2 Day service and did not receive my items even remotely close to the time. The customer service reps continue to say that the warehouse is busy and that it was sent out express, when clearly it wasn't. I personally called the carrier and they said ASOS DID NOT send it express. Yet the ASOS reps keep saying ""our systems show that we mailed it express."" While I have spent a lot of money over the years with ASOS, I too will no longer buy anything from there as clearly ASOS is not willing to hold themselves accountable for the recent crap job that they have done.

As I used a money off voucher for £30 they essentially invalidated it after I returned an item?

My event I needed the package for has long passed. Why would they offer 2 day shipping it they can't even come close to that and then just say you have to continue to wait, sorry.

            I am a regular customer on ASOS. Have been for many years, it’s my number one place to shop.PROS - customer service very friendly, ALWAYS solve any problems.- free delivery over 25 pounds.- VERY quick with refunds! CONS- I’ve noticed the quality in their own brand isn’t very good. The ‘ASOS design’.  all seem to shrink, lose shape, after one wash. I’ve stopped buying their own stuff now. Especially T-shirt’s and dresses. - they got rid of their A LIST club, I thought this was a lovely way to give back to customers. It made them stand out from the rest.

            Ordered a maternity package and only 1 of the 4 items arrived, a dress. They told me I need to send back the dress and order the package again but it’s sold out. I can’t even keep the dress unless I pay the full amount for all items. And when I send back the dress there is not even a way they’re going to sell it again as part of an incomplete package so for their business it’s just harming customer satisfaction without any financial benefit. They make a mistake and I get the effort to fix it, send it back, ensure I get a refund, and not even have the only item I actually did get. Do not recommend ordering here. First time I leave a bad review on Trustpilot so not one of those always complaining, but really disappointed about the lack of customer focus.

Always got my money, parcels never gone missing etc. Just keep your returns receipt just in case and they will still refund you the money. Couldn’t fault the company at all. I liked Asos a list when they had it also as I got a few vouchers out of it. I ordered something on next day delivery once and it didn’t turn up the next day, however I contacted them and they gave me my postage money back without bother! No issues. Would recommend.

            Worst customer care ever period. Order a hoodie and t-shirts. Did not arrive within estimated date. Even though paid for tracked delivery, did not receive tracking reference number. They claim first order was missing so they sent out a replacement. Replacement order didn't arrive within estimated date. The only response I got was to wait for X amount of days for both orders until I was able to contact their specialist team.

            PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE heed my review. Like most, I went to this website reading reviews about how poor of a job ASOS has done with terms of shipping and delivery. Unfortunately, I did not take these reviews seriously and ordered a dress expecting it to arrive on said due date. I hashed an extra $8 out for express delivery, for I needed the dress for a spring formal dance. Express delivery said the dress would be here in four days from the time I ordered it. It has been 7 days, and I JUST received an email saying my item's shipping label has been made. It hasn't even been shipped! The day that my item will actually be shipped is two days later from now, and there is no information for when it will arrive. Please take my word for it and DO NOT order from this website expecting delivery to be prompt. Give yourself at LEAST 3-4 weeks cushion for your parcels to arrive if ordering from here.-A very angry and broke high schooler

            DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM AS THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THEIR WEBSITE.I placed an order for three maternity dresses which never arrived. They refused to provide  a tracking number and advised me that they had shipped without one.I now opened a dispute case with Paypal to get my refund because I had zero trust Asos would do the right thing...also they are waiting for the very last moment to reply to the Paypal Investigator or I'm guessing they will not reply at all...the only thing is they are intentional being ""doucheba*s"" and delaying the return of my money.

            1 star its alot for what I'm feeling at the moment. I have never in my entire live had such a bad service! Ordered a dress with Next day delivery. Total order £80. The reason why Ive ordered the dress is because on 3rd of March, at 8am I have my son's christening and couldn't find anything nice out shopping. DPF lost the dress, apparently disappeared, and Asos didn't care and had nothing to say. 3 hours I've spend on the phone with them trying to get in touch to a manager and they told me he is on the phone with a cust for the past three hours!! They didn't want to reimburse me the money when I've told them to cancel my order because the need to investigate with DPF what happened to the parcel! I have explained that thats their problems product not mine I havent even seen it therefore it's between them still won't release my funds back! This is called stealing! And last me left me in tears before my son Christening which is due tomorrow and ended the call on me. U took my money didn't deliver your promise next day delivery and left me with no dress on such an important event. Besides everything you just wrecked my entire day before such a special time to us. I cannot wait to take this further like I said I will taking you guys to court for helding my money unlawfully! The woman kept repeting herself saying the dress will be here on the 4th! I have explained a million times I need it on the 3rd. Stay away from those horrible awful not caring people!

            I started buying from ASOS last year and I really liked their merchandise, so much that I signed up for one year of 2 day shipping for $19.99, which was an awesome price. Things went well for about 5 orders which were delivered in exactly 2 working days. I was a happy camper until my Feb 16, 2019 order. First I was told a delivery date of Feb 26, which is not 2 days. I asked and was told that the reason for the delay was that there has been a lot of businesses from the US. Not my fault! Then I get notified by Fedex of a delivery date of March 2. Two days later, it was changed to March 6, and the package has been shipped since Feb 26 from Georgia. What the heck!! Is Fedex taking the scenic route???? I enquired about this delay and was a given a generic answer, which means no help whatsoever! I don’t intend to buy anymore from ASOS.

            Same experiences as everyone else. No tracking info. Won't share why beyond a canned response that I kept getting, over and over, by ""EBONY"" on their chat. I was told there tracking info wasn't available due to the large volume in orders recently (makes absolutely no sense) and then when I asked ""How do you know then it's still on time if you haven't given me nor have a tracking number for this order?"" I was told ""There is no tracking number for this order I'm afraid. If you do not receive your order by the end of the day please get back in touch and we will get this looked into further for you."" As I continued to complain about the process and share how frustrated I was, the chat screen was silent...They have a few other options that are available for reaching out (and the chat is only available if you get it at the right time) which include FB messenger, tweeting, email, etc. I also sent them a FB message and am not having any movement on that end either.This isn't normal. My gut tells me they don't have a lot of these items or are about to go bankrupt/out of business and are trying to rake in the last bit of $$$  they can before they need to pay it back. I've already notified my bank that I may be contesting a charge.

            So I decided to look up reviews on ASOS as this is my first time shopping with them and it’s been a bit shady. I placed an order on Feb 17 and like most negative reviews here, I was told it should arrive on or before March 1st. Here it is March 2... no package, no tracking info. I sent an email to see what’s up and got a response that there was a delay and delivery is to be pushed back to the 5th. Ummm ya.. after reading some of these reviews I am loosing cofindence to say the least. I’ve NEVER had such issues ordering online. This should not be happening on such a large scale and it’s quite sad. I typically don’t write reviews, but something needs to be done about this or ppl should be aware of what they are getting into when attempting to shop with this company. The positive reviews must be done by ASOS employers trying to do some damage control bc there are WAY too many similar complaints. I’m glad I didn’t place an enormous order with them bc I would be beyond furious. I kept my order minimal on purpose as a test run and let’s just say that I’m not impressed. Now, let’s see if I acually receive my coats and the shipping reimbursement as promised. It’s whatever if I don’t get the shipping reimbursement, but if I don’t receive my orders/they are messed up somehow and I have to take the time to fight w/them to get order or refund - I will loose it bc it’s not just about the money it’s about the principle. If you can’t handle the current volume of your business, its time to downsize to improve quality - period.

            As a once faithful ASOS shopper I have witnessed how they have become crappier with each passing year. Years ago they used to have one of the best customer services, free shipping (on U.S. orders) with no minimum (it eventually moved up to a minimum of $25 which I think was still pretty reasonable and now it's at $50), and an awesome selection of decently priced clothes for the quality. This is no longer the case.Anyway, I made a purchase from them a couple of weeks ago. For my shipping option I chose Click & Collect (which means you can have them send your item to a UPS store and then you can go pick it up when it's delivered there). So I noticed that I never received a notification that my package was ready although it was a couple of days past the expected delivery date. I drove down to the UPS store and they said to come back later as they didn't seem to have much information as to where it was and that maybe the delivery truck would bring it to the store later. Later that day before heading out back to UPS I checked the tracking and it stated ""DELIVERY REJECTED, RETURNING TO SENDER"".  I was completely confused so I called UPS. They stated that ASOS shipped my package with UPS SurePost which does not allow packages to be collected from UPS store but has to be completed with the post office delivering to my home mailbox. Therefore, when my package was delivered to the UPS store it was rejected and returned without me even being notified. UPS told me there was nothing they could do about it and to get in contact with ASOS. I then contacted ASOS in attempt to figure out why they would give me the option of Click & Collect but then send my package with SurePost. They didn't give me an answer. They also stated that they couldn't return the package and that I would have to reorder (annoying since the item was now out of stock). I was a little upset but what really sent me over the edge was their response when I asked if they were also going to refund my shipping. They said they would refund my order but NOT the shipping. I told them that was unacceptable and why if it was their mistake am I not being refunded every single dollar I paid. They stated because the shipping had a tracking number and so it can’t be refunded. So what if it had a tracking number?! YOU incorrectly sent it through the wrong service so again, WHY am I the one being penalized for your mistake? This is the move that hit the final nail in the coffin for me—- they ended the chat lol. Top tier customer service right there. I told them I would never purchase from them again and I mean it. They lost a faithful customer over $5 they could have easily (and should have rightfully) refunded me.

It STILL has not shipped and when I spoke with someone last night they told me not to ask until after the delivery date. -__-   Because by some miracle it could arrive and they just forgot to send a tracking number?

Then after nearly 30 minutes, she simply abruptly hung up mid chat stating she could no longer help me. I paid for express delivery which will end up taking nearly 2 weeks instead of the 2 days listed on the site. Please save yourself the headache and DO NOT shop with ASOS.

I ordered a gorgeous outfit that I was really excited to receive and after waiting until the suggested delivery date (which is fine, I didn't pay for shipping) I still had yet to receive my order. When I inquired, I received cut and paste responses and was told to wait another two weeks for my order to arrive. I told them that I was moving and they refused to do anything until the two weeks had passed. It was infuriating and I will no longer be shopping w ASOS. What a disappointment.

            My experience shopping with ASOS was not that wow. Refund is ok, better when they changed it to FREE, although sometimes they missed out 1 or 2 items or refunding the wrong items. That is probably normal in their standard of operation. Customer service is ok, they always reply on time as expected. One time, as I always shop with my APP, they had a deal of ""spend $250, get $70 discount"", it tripped me so good, I lost my money! I didn't get my refund, and as I didn't know that the rules was very strict. I argued and argued with no LUCK, the policy was really strict but it was not apparent in their APP! I lost my money I was so upset. I stopped shopping with ASOS maybe for 1 year.They do have great stuff which we do not get here in NZ. So to get some variety, now and then, I sometime would buy something. One more thing, some brands in ASOS do not have generic sizing, they are much more smaller than the generic sizing! watch out! Glamorous usually have 1-2 sizes smaller than standard. I bought tops size 10 and fitted my friend who was size 8 small. I had to return everything!

            I have worked in retail my entire life and I am absolutely shocked at their customer service. I ordered something on February 16th and it said it would be delivered on or before March 1st. I am leaving out of town March 2nd I figured surely it will arrive on or before that date. I tracked the package on February 27th knowing I was leaving out of town soon and it showed it was in Atlanta, GA and that it was going to be delivered March 4th. I reached out to customer care with screenshots and explained my situation hoping for help and was met with generic responses. Their solution is to wait until after March 1st. But if I wait until after that I will be left without my order- that I ordered knowing it would be delivered by then. It sounds dramatic but I feel helpless! I love their clothes, but if they want to be solely online they need to be better with their customer service.

            I am leaving for my trip tomorrow afternoon, and I will not be receiving my order on time. Brace yourselves for this LONG review:I ordered my dress on 2/15 to ensure PLENTY of time for arrival as I have a trip coming up on 3/1. In order to be extra safe (so I thought), I decided to upgrade to 2 day shipping. As I was checking out I realized the ETA for my order was 2/26. HMMMM...definitely not 2 day shipping. Although bothered, I figured I'd rather pay extra for the ""2 day shipping""  and receive it 2/26 than take my chance with regular shipping. As the days passed I grew worried that my dress would not make it in time ESPECIALLY because I hadn't received any tracking information. I reached out to customer service, which was not the slightest bit of help. you will never receive a response from the same representative. Not only that, but they don't even read through your whole email and give faulty information. Anyway, I did not end up with tracking info until 2/23 (3 days before ETA.) It is now 2/28 and my package will not be arriving any time soon. Received an email today saying it will arrive on 3/7. LOL. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ASOS IF YOU NEED SPEEDY SHIPPING.

I try contacting customer service twice and it was completely useless, I need to leave town tomorrow for the wedding and they say it will be delivered, but how can I delay my trip and trust this scam call ASOS?!I used to be a customer, never again!

            2 stars only. The guys from ASOS would say why? What did we wrong?I already ordered a couple of things and it came on time, perfect :) . When i opened the parcel it was the right size and it was ironed and clean, good.BUT i ordered i couple of clothes and shoes ASOS brand. The design for the price is nice, but shoes are not comfy, and the jacket inside is the worst made i saw in my life.So, use Asos for ordering clothes but my suggestion is do never order ASOS brand clothes made in china with the cheapest materials you will regret it.Totally disappointed with your quality brand clothes guys. Personally i would increase your quality controls.Although I'll keep ordering other brands in your webpage.

            Ordered two items with 2-day shipping on 2/16. After ordering, the info in my account stated that the items would arrive on 2/25. On 2/24, I received an email saying there would be a delay of ONE day, meaning it should've turned up on 2/26. It is now 2/27 and they have stopped responding to my queries.

I contacted them after the agreed date had passed to be told I'd been passed on to a ""specialist team"" who would contact me within 24 hours...30 minutes later I received a notification fro Paypal saying my order had been cancelled and I'd been issued a refund....I didn't want or ask for a refund!

            I had multiple good experiences with ASOS until my most recent (and what will be my last) order. I returned the items from my order using the included return label and same packaging, just as I have in the past. However this time, ASOS reported they never received it. Also, hidden in their terms and conditions on some deep portion of their website, says that they recommend you receive a shipping receipt for returns because you are responsible for your items until they receive them.  This is not listed anywhere readily available to the consumer, including the multiple confirmation email(s) or the step by step return instructions on the shipping label. I spoke with Hannah from customer service who literally told me there was nothing she can do. Now I am out $230 and have no clothing or anything to show for it. I will never be ordering from ASOS again and will no longer recommend them to friends and family.

            The last THREE 'express' orders I've made have arrived 7 days after the delivery date. Further to this, each and everytime I've had to check tracking due to 'attempted delivery' however I was home and one 'attempted delivery' was at 5am... surely that's not legal.. eventually I got the first package after no less than 10 emails and still waiting for my second and third packages which were meant to arrive 4 days ago. Ever since they've changed to Skynet Express it's been beyond terrible customer service and delivery standards. Also quite cowardly that they don't allow you to post on their fb wall.... clearly they know the issue but too high on their cost cutting exercise. Not sure I'll be a returning customer this time!

            ASOS is ok as long as they are collecting your money. As soon as there is any issue which involves them investigating and putting right they become very unhelpful.  I ordered goods for next day delivery and the courier lied that they tried to deliver but that no one was in. I suspect they did this because they couldn't locate the doorway of the flat (being on top of shops). I contacted ASOS to ask them to give the courier directions but I was told they couldn't do that and that I should contact the couriers myself. I found this very unhelpful as I was not changing delivery address only giving extra directions. It's now the third day and the courier still has not showed up. I have been a very long standing customer but in the light of this I'm considering to stop buying from you.

            I placed an orderon Feb 18 and paid for 2-day express delivery, knowing I needed the items on Feb. 22/23. I discovered on Feb. 21 that they'd pushed back my delivery date until Feb. 25. I contacted two separate agents regarding this (one actually hung up on me) and was told/given a link to where this was supposedly posted on the website. However that post was timestamped Feb. 20 - two days after my order - so not relevant.On Feb. 25, I received an email that the order will be delayed AGAIN and won't arrive until after Feb. 26th. They'd still not even shipped anything.The events for which I needed the items had now passed and I was about to travel out of the location where I'd ordered the items shipped - and not planning to return to that location. I contacted them via chat and Twitter and it was like pulling teeth to get a response, let alone a refund...which I still waiting for. They are definitely understaffed, but also obviously incompetent.

            The customer services are equally bad to all. Recently I purchased some items and cancelled because I've changed my mind and ask for a refund. But after 10 days, I continue to seek for my refund, at first they asked me to wait for a couple of days for it and if not, I should get back to them. But after a few days, the money is still not in. They told me I need to prove that I've purchased those items and my bank statement. My bank statement did not show the purchase as it was cancelled immediately and they wouldn't want to refund it and I'm out of a bit quite of cash. I would say not recommended, not even worth mentioning.

            Don't trust the other negative reviews. They are mostly based on poor customer service.I'm DJ transaction. You can check me out in Instagram. I stumbled into asos because I was searching for a cotton/linen suit and asos was the first search result. I see the pics on the website and they look great. The prices were dirt cheap. Then I did some research and came here. I saw many negative reviews. But I decided to take a risk; I also saw a suit I really wanted for dirt cheap. I bought it Feb 16 2019 with $3 extra for shipping. Today is Feb 22 and it just arrived. The suit has exceeded my expectations. It fits me perfectly with no tailoring required. I was happy with this purchase and will go after the higher end stuff on this site with confidence.

            I have to say that the customer service from ASOS is the WORST I have ever experienced! even as a loyal customer.I ordered an item to be delivered to my current address but their website changed it to an old address which I obviously don't live at anymore.  The package was supposedly delivered and signed for by the person at said address so I decided to go and check for myself, SHOCK there was no package at any of the houses along that street.Barnaby at ASOS was extremely rude and showed no willingness to help either get the item sent to the correct address or issue a refund.Barnaby kept asking me to go and collect the parcel from the address it was delivered despite telling him/her 4 times that the item is nowhere to be seen at any address.I am now out of pocket and still no step closer to getting a resolution.I will no longer use ASOS and advise the many customers I know not too as well.I really hope you up your game and train your staff on how to speak to customers.Last but not least I was on live chat to Barnaby and he just closed the chat on me out of the blue after challenging him/her on the issue.I will present this issue with trading standards.

            Horrible return process. Ordered a jacket which did not fit properly.First of all they don't offer an exchange only a refund and then you have to order again. Which is not a great service but would be OK if the refund would happen in a timely manner.. Which it doesn't.I am waiting for the refund since 5 weeks now - even though it says in their website that it can take up to 10 days. It's a joke.Will never order again.

            Don’t pay for two day $19.00 one year shipping scam. I did about 3 weeks ago. The promise  2day delivery for one year on any product. My first delivery was received 3 days late. My third order of February 16 has not arrived. Today is February 20 and their email to me says” thank you for you feb 16 order. Your order will arrive on or before feb 26. That’s 10 days from my order and not 2 as promised. This company is a FRAUD. Don’t pay the 19.00 for guaranteed 2 day delivery because it won’t happen. What will happen is that they will STEAL YOUR MONEY BY FRAUD!

            To be honest I'm very surprised with all the bad reviews. I don't know about the express delivery because i'm using only the normal delivery and so far didn't have any issues. I'm shopping online many years now and I can surely say that I found ASOS to be one of the ""good"" companies selling good quality products. You can find expensive AND normal items. They have a variety of clothes. Also the return is very easy and FREE.

            I thought this was only happening to me but it seems everyone is experiencing the two day shipping disaster. My items won’t arrive in time for when I actually needed them, which was a week after order so as you can see  I thought I gave myself ample time. Aside from “2-day” turning out to be 2 WEEKS, the live chat support was the most disrespectful experience I’ve ever had with customer care in my life. After being a loyal customer of theirs for years, I thought I’d return to a smooth transaction process after a year hiatus. But it seems things have changed. Sad situation.

            ASOS is no longer a site I will be purchasing from, from the horrible quality of clothes that have only dwindled even further to the lack of customer service. They delayed my order for over 1 week and no one messaged to inform me. Meanwhile I pay for 2 day delivery. Most of the clothes I have ordered are see through Polyester clothes that look too cheap to wear in public. Shame on a what was once an okay place to shop.

            Ordered 3 dresses yesterday and selected next day delivery for today.Got an email at 4am today saying one of the dresses is out of stock and I'll be refunded which I didn't actually see given the send time - first disappointment. They say they hold your items but sell them elsewhere.Anyway, my partner waited in between the hour delivery slot they gave us - no items came and I got a text to say they attempted delivery but no one answered. Ended up having to call DPD who said they hadn't actually received the order from ASOS so no idea why I was given tracking info - waste of my partners time. I was told to contact ASOS directly. While on live chat with ASOS, I received another email from DPD saying they did have it, but the driver went to the wrong address. Good job the incorrect address tenants weren't in or theyd have had my dresses for free - though they do now have the calling card and potentially my personal information. ASOS customer services were largely unhelpful, offered no real apology, and their best solution was to have it redelivered on a day not to my convenience. They offered delivery between now (Tues) and next Thursday. I asked for Sunday as it is the only day I'll be home. Then told it wasn't possible to guarantee Sunday delivery. I asked them to deliver to my partners work - not possible for them. Now I have to go and pick it up myself from a local depot.Honestly the worst online purchasing experience I've had in years, and after all that hassle, I saw the email saying the nicest of the three dresses is out of stock anyway and wont be delivered.

            I paid for 2 days shipping in order to have a dress for an event this upcoming weekend. I ordered on the 17th thinking that would give me plenty of time to get the dress and make sure everything was in order. Then came today, the 19th, when the dress should've arrived and lo-and-behold ASOS says it'll be here the 26th, instead. They told me I should've known as it showed as estimated delivery and would not refund me for the extra cost of 2 day shipping. That is was simply my fault, and not theirs for offering a quicker option and not making good on it.

            I really want to give zero starts but that option is unavailable, so I guess one will have to do. I was charged $8 for 2-day shipping. But now my shipment tracking says that my order won’t arrive for over a week. It explicitly stated at the checkout that it was going to be TWO-DAY shipping. Then I wrote to the customer service team to try and remedy the situation. Not only was Molly—my customer service rep—ridiculously unhelpful, but she was also rude and ended the chat before we were done speaking. This company just lost one customer and I would advise any and all shoppers to watch out for little tricks they play when charging you for services that go completely unrendered.

            TERRIBLE. I have shopped here before and had very mediocre customer service experience. After I had not received my packaged passed the delivery date they just told me they can't really do anything and to just wait!! This time their system glitched and during checkout increased the quantity of an item in my bag after I refreshed it. I saw it after an hour and they told me they can't do anything and if I want to return it I have to pay a fee of $22.40. Are you kidding me? This is fraud.UPDATE: its been well past my order's expected delivery date and my order still isnt here. They have no clue where it is and asked me to wait 20 MORE DAYS and then contact them then!! WOW Also every time you connect with a representative to chat, they totally ignore you for at least 5 minutes and they try to finish the chat ASAP without being helpful at all.

Each time I reach out to state so, customer service is so rude and sometimes even disconnects the chat so they don’t have to deal. They give you the run around and just state they are not responsible for late shipping - ummm then who is?!!

First time instead of dress that I payed around 25£ I got a black shirt really bad quality that looks like it costs 5£ (not even). Then second time I ordered Adidas dress size M, and I got size S. And last and final time I ordered really light purple shirt and I got dark purple shirt totaly different then what I ordered. There is obviously a reason why we can do online shopping.

Never again!!

            I decided to give ASOS a try. First time with ASOS here.I was super scared, highly sceptical and slightly hesitate about buying from ASOS as I came on here and read all the reviews , however, they do have a nice range of clothing which caught my eye.When deciding to buy from ASOS and then reading these review, I had a feeling I might head into a shark infested waters.While I did take all these reviews onboard, I decided to risk it and find out myself if the shopping experience with ASOS was as challenging as most of these shopper have mentioned here. I think, as I am based in the UK, orders might be better for UK residents as are a UK business and are actually based in the UK. I may only assume people buying overseas might get challenging issues with shipments and orders with ASOS as there is a distance with deliveries.I wrote to the chat box of ASOS and chatted with a person from ASOS voicing my concerns about ordering from ASOS. He was very reassuring my order would arrive and I shouldn't be worried.I order three items and they all came - even arrived early. ASOS constantly informed me by email where my order was on route. Yodel delivered the items and were very friendly also sending me text letting me know where my items were. I had order two pair of shoes and a dress. The dress was great, size was good which means ASOS is true to their size charts for me. One pair of the shoes were fabulous however the second pair( fabulous too!) were a tad too small. Nothing wrong with the shoes, my feet are a bit wide, hence one pair crammed my feet.So I embarked on the return. This is where I was a bit scared after reading the reviews and thought maybe this is were ASOS was going to be a bit of a nightmare. Followed the instructions, returned it by free post via Royal Mail. They offer other options for free delivery, however, to be honest, I feel Royal Mail is the safest. Within 2 days, I got an email stating they received my returned item and my refund will be processed shortly. Within 2 days my full refund was in my account.While it looks like many people who have left reviews here , have had a challenging time with ASOS, Im glad I took the plunge and did buy from them. Overall, my experience has been excellent with ASOS and I hope to buy from them again.

            Never had an issue with Asos. Been shopping with them for over 5years now. Always delivered on or before the delivery date. Returns are free and easy and within 2 weeks I have my refund. This week I received a parcel and one of the earrings were missing from the packet I had purchased so I contacted Asos who immediately rectified the issue by sending a replacement free of charge and only asked me to despose of the spare earring in the most environmentally friendly way possible or keep as a spare. So many different brands and styles to choose from. I love asos and would highly recommend the shopping brand.

            DO NOT USE - Ordered same day delivery twice through asos, never recieved my parcel both times.  If you live in London DO NOT use.  Waste of money. Finally got my refund a month later. They say they have attempted delivery but I was in the whole time and they did not once attempt delivery. I've told Asos about this and after telling me it was delivered after me arguing they accepted it wasn't. Customer service is appalling.

            I placed an order with ASOS today an hour ago and had forgotten to amend my delivery address. I logged onto live chat to be told that as I wasn’t within the 15 minute grace period I couldn’t cancel and re-order or change my delivery address!! Expected to believe that the order has already been packed and sent for delivery?! Yeah right! I spoke with Laura on LiveChat who then told me as she had already explained I cannot do anything, she was ending the chat!!! Really bad customer service to just cut off someone on Live Chat - and ridiculous that an hour after ordering I cannot make amendments or cancel!

            I desperately needed some trainers as a gift to be delivered today (13th Feb). I paid for next day delivery to guarantee this.I received an SMS at 7am saying my order couldn't be delivered today and to contact ASOS. I contacted ASOS and they initiated a 'return to sender' request at 1am. They said my order will be returned to them and I'll be given a refund.I have never had a company sell me a product with guaranteed next day delivery and then stop my order from reaching me at 1am, I'm simply lost for words.I've now got no present to give to a loved one and have purchased the same item from a competitor of ASOS who have guaranteed me next day delivery. ASOS asked me to order from them again but if they don't know why they cancelled my order as it was being delivered last time then it is likely to happen again.I was a brand new customer who had never purchased from ASOS before, this was the first transaction and the start of our relationship. I would give them 0 stars if possible. I wish I had checked their review ratings - they are rated terrible for a reason, please do yourself a favour and buy from a more caring and organised company.I wanted to make a formal complaint, I was told that I had to do it using their website which is more for troubleshooting. After much hassle I wrote a complaint.The person completely ignored all of my written text and treated me as though I was a happy customer checking on their order - very poor.The response I received is below:Thanks for contacting us at ASOS. Sorry to hear you didn't receive your order 388914318 and it's being returned to us.I've checked your order for you and it's on its way back to our warehouse due to you explaining you wouldn't need this order unless it arrived at a certain point.We're unable to resend your order to you. As soon as we've received the parcel, we'll refund the cost of the items and send you an email to let you know.Please allow 7 working days for your parcel to arrive at our warehouse and be processed. We'll drop you an email when it’s been done. It may take 5-10 working days for funds to show in your account.If you haven't received a returns confirmation email by the 22nd of February let us know and we can look into this for you.I'm really sorry your order didn't reach you. If you still want the items and they're still available, please order them through our website as normal as I'm unable to place your order for you, for security reasons. An easy way to do this is to log into your account, view the original order and then add the items you want back into your shopping bag.We make every effort to ensure that you receive your orders on time and are happy with our service. I'm really sorry you're being asked to wait a little longer; occasionally there are postal delays which are outside our control.If you have any more queries in the meantime, get back in touch and I'd be more than happy to help.Best Wishes,

            I sent back 2 items worth £200 and didn't receive a refund for a month! The representatives were rude and took a long time to help me out, that was until I informed them I still have a receipt from the post office. That's when they immediately decided to put me onto their specialist team to receive an email in 24 hours.... and about 12 hours later my refund was confirmed, meaning that they likely received the delivery more than 2 weeks prior to this and decided to not give any refund until I reminded them. One of the worst customer service that I have come across on an e-commerce.

Instead of the classy cut lace dress pictured on their site that I ordered for a wedding in a few weeks, I received a cheap  blue lace dress (like lace curtains) that is OBVIOUSLY not what was pictured.The customer service agent I spoke with couldn't ensure I would be sent the correct item if I ordered again. The dresses are made by the same company, Chi Chi London, but are very different. I feel like I was sent an inferior product on purpose. Customer service was poor as well. Don't think I'll try for the correct dress.

            Somone really needs to check out ASOS and their undelivered items policy. The item does not belong to me until it is delivered yet i am being told to wait weeks to allow the courier to find something before they will think about refunding anything. How can this be logical? I bought something, they failed to deliver, yet i have to wait. If you have a car accident your insurance pays for it and then chases the other car for money, if the courier loses an item it should be the same. The customer should not be made to pay. Allowing Hermes 2 weeks to find an item is an agreement ASOS have with Hermes, not me, and they did not state this anywhere on their website. Yes of course allow a delivery company one or 2 days extra, but 2 weeks? And then i have to start the process again. And then they can take weeks to issue an refund......sad thing is, if they had just refunded i would have re-ordered. Or they could have just resent the item.....but they are effectively treating me as though i am the one in the wrong....i hope they crash! (ASOS, not the courier)

            I've been a customer of Asos for years! I've never experience an issue with this company and have just realised how brilliant they are. They are very easy to deal with and honestly I've never had to contact them regarding an issue of an order because there hasn't been any. But all the orders that have been placed through them, I've always received the order on time, and anything I don't like they offer a free return service which is really easy. The quality of ASOS clothes is great, and so is the Klarna service that they are using which lets us pay later.

            After placing my order and paying almost GBP 20 for express international service I received an email from the courier company with the tracking number except the tracking number lead me to a page that states that my package was delivered in July 2018. I contacted customer service who stated that as per the courier there is no record of my shipment but as per Asos I should receive my order by the 14th of Feb.  I am not sure why or how the customer service representative thought that his email would in anyway comfort me or resolve my issue if he stated that the courier has no record of my shipment. I continued to correspond with customer service and every time a different person replied but using the same template email stating that if I do not get my package on Feb 14th then to get in touch. I tried explaining that I would no longer need the package after that date and that the reason I paid for express shipping for an item that cost the same as the shipping is because I needed it urgently. The response I received was mind blowing they stated "" if you no longer need the item after late arrival then you can return it"".  Again I am not sure how that was the solution when all I needed were the correct tracking details and to be sure that my package existed and was shipped. Instead of copying and pasting emails maybe someone from customer service could have picked up the phone and called the courier company who ""had no record of my order""! in the end  I did actually receive my order today 11 February, so I guess Asos and their courier service have no clue what they are sending out and when..

            I placed an order on the US site and received an email that the items would arrive February 6. I gave it until the 9th, but still nothing has arrived. I chatted with an ASOS customer service rep who provided tracking showing delivery on February 13, a whole week later. They have good prices and items I like, but I won't be returning to a business that can't follow through on their own word. If the email simply stated it'd take that long, then I would have had another gift lined up instead of waiting on them and now having to do something else last minute.

            Terrible customer service, refuse to accept accountability for deliveries showing up. Paid for next day delivery (expected item to be delivered Tuesday), for DPD to lie about attempting delivery TWICE (I was at home after taking 2 days off work to make sure I didn’t miss this). After hours of emailing ASOS and DPD to get this rectified, I was told by ASOS that they had attempted delivery twice, and sorry I had missed it. Beyond infuriating when you are trying to raise a complaint and explain their couriers’ misconduct, however their policy is apparently to blame the customer. Never ordering with them again. Also, still not received my delivery, and told by DPD that I will have to collect it now on Monday, due to them having technical issues. Absolute shambles of organisations.

Placed order on Friday morning for Saturday delivery and after tracking Saturday night found out won’t be with me until Monday!!!This has happened more than once.The online chat is awful, no help just told me it will be coming Monday but they cannot do anything until Saturday has ended as it may still come even though stated that it be until Monday! Won’t refund my premier subscription or send another item out for delivery Sunday as the one coming Monday could but won’t show up Saturday.Won’t send a replacement or refund.So in all it’s a 3 day service called next day.

            I have used ASOS for years but have finally decided it is more hassle than it’s worth after two really poor experiences. Twice now I have been charged for orders that didn’t go through due to technical glitches on the website. This has resulted in my money being waiting to be refunded, which on one occasion took a number of weeks. I had great difficulty getting help from customer services and it took many calls and a lot of time to resolve. In the end it was paypal that was more helpful. I would not recommend ASOS.

            I'm very surprised by all the negative reviews as I have shopped a lot with ASOS and never had a problem/problem not resolved. I've had every refund processed properly. I received one incorrect item and they sorted it immediately. I received a parcel so badly damaged not all the items were in it and they rectified that immediately (they sent a cardboard box instead of their plastic bags - ASOS stick with the bags please!). They are often more expensive than other places but I think you are paying for the customer service and free delivery and quality of how they advertise their products (videos). I only don't shop with them now since their rewards scheme ended and I suspect they have lost other people's business because of this as it looks lately like their profits had taken a down turn. Bring back the points scheme/rewards scheme ASOS!

            Absolutely awful customer service at asos. They have no interest in helping you resolve the issue. I’ve done two live chat with two different people who both ended the chat before resolving the issue or giving me a chance to respond to what they sent back. Devinia the first person didn’t help at all and clearly couldn’t be bothered. Kirsten the second person attempted too but then just gave up and closed the chat. The issue I have is still unresolved and I’m still waiting for a response. Honestly don’t waste your time with this company. Go else where to other companies that appreciate your loyalty and are actually willing to help you. I know understand why there’s so many negative reviews and totally agree with them!

            Asos have the worst customer services I've ever dealt with. The agents are unable to answer basic questions and just copy/paste the same generic responses to emails - most of the time it doesn't even read as though they've actually read the email properly. Still waiting for a refund of £160 for 2 items that weren't delivered on an order in DECEMBER. Have sent them around 10 emails in total over the past 1.5 months trying to resolve it - finally got to the point of them saying they would refund, now waiting over a week for the refund. Asked today for the transaction reference or some details but they are unable to provide anything. Have used Asos almost exclusively for online clothes shopping for well over 5 years, recommended them to many people, but will obviously no longer dos so. You really find out a lot about a company when something goes wrong and how they deal with it. The customer service agents either don't care or are just bad at their jobs.

            Terrible terrible service.My order was obviously not delivered as Hermes are terrible and lost it.  I received confirmation from Hermes that it has been lost and sent this to ASOS as advised by Hermes.  ASOS told me they were unable to contact Hermes, even via their email service as it is not a ‘business line’ and have said they are not able to contact their contracted courier at all.  Furthermore, they refuse to refund my money or send a replacement until 2 weeks have passed since the order was placed - so are effectively withholding money.I have reported this to further to the Retail ADR - I see online this has become a common problem with ASOS and believe they need to be investigated.

            I had a good experience before, until 4 weeks ago when I did not see my 2 parcels arriving, and wanted to get more information on the matter on the online chat, the customer care of one of them was disgusting. He was showing me how much I bored him and That he did not have time for me. But I was happy when a few days ago the customer care of asos messenger helped me to get my money back. However today when I wanted to order back my stuff I saw that asos shipping fee jumped for 4usd to 31.68 usd. And free shipping from 31.68 to 315 usd. Honestly I live in a small country where the salary is not that great and if the shipping price are jumping that high I prefer to look for another online clothing site, as for us its quite expensive. And when my friends and relatives got to know about it their reaction was the same. I don't think I will ever buy there again.

            This company is terrible. I ordered a parcel and paid next day delivery, it did not turn up for 3 days so I changed it to go to a local parcel shop, it then could not be delivered due to a unforeseen problem. I was then told it had been rejected and was 'on it's way back to the ASOS warehouse' only to find that I had been lied to and this was never the case - it had been sat in that shop for 2 weeks and I hadn't received my refund. When I asked them what was going on they said that I had to go and collect it and sort it out despite them telling me it had all been sorted previously. Absolutely ridiculous! They were basically asking ME to do their job for them. I also received NO apology.

            Atroscious customer service skills (or lack of) from most the team in the customer care department (namely Kamran- no customer service whatsoever). ASOS as a brand is going downhill and I can now see why. They’re more interested in sending automated responses as opposed to actually understand customer issues and properly looking into them. Changing their couriers as well resulting in a number if delays, even though you chose and pay for next day delivery, and then their staff have the audacity to say wait till midnight to see if the item gets delivered? Sorry, what?Extremely disappointed asos customer for over 5 years. Fair to say, I’ll be slowly stopping using the website. Drastic changes required to their business model if they wish to stand any chance of competing in the market.

            I don't understand the other reviews as I've never had a bad experience whilst shopping with Asos.com! I do a lot of shopping on this site and have subscribed to the unlimited next day delivery for £9.99 and my parcels are always on delivered on time. When I have received a package that has been faulty (has only happened once or twice), I contacted them on Twitter via DM and they responded within the hour and the problem was immediately rectified. I would definitely recommend Asos to my friends and I think that the Next Day Delivery package is well worth it!! :)

            Honestly, the worst. I didn't get a returns slip and when I enquired as to when they would send me a new one they took great pleasure in telling me that they didn't do that, then they told me to go to a local library or a family members house to use the printer. NOT THE POINT. The point is, you, the retailer, screwed up. Take responsibility for that and stop asking your already inconvenienced customers to be further inconvenienced. When I tried to get them to take responsibility, the person left the chat.

            Horrible customer serviceIf they send the wrong item to you and want a refund you have to wait a month before you get your money back. First you have to pick it up for a warehouse, resend the item which can take a week or more then this “It can take up to 14 working days to arrive back at our warehouse” “funds will show in your account within 5-10 working days of the refund being completed.” 100% their mistake but offer nothing in return.From what I have read this is not uncommon.

            I've just figured out the Asos scam.If you read a lot of the negative ( and a few of the positive ) reviews, it's a common occurrence that us buyers will either be sent the wrong size, or the wrong order.Meanwhile, the department they laughingly call ""customer service"", advise that stocks are low of the item you require, and that if you still want the item, you really ought to order now, whilst stocks last.So you return the order, and order another size or item. At this point the buyer has no goods, but Asos has 2 payments, so who's on top at this point?If foolishly, like me, you order a third time ( and of course, you're GUARANTEED not to get the correct order again ) and they send the wrong item again ( incredibly my third order arrived in the box associated with the product, but with a completely different product inside! ) now Asos have 3 of your payments and you have no goods.Imagine if they can scam a mere 10 people like that per week: they're holding onto funds that aren't theirs, which they can do whatever they want with. It could certainly be making them money whilst it's still in their account. I know a lot of companies do this but not for 20 DAYS!!And why the hell should it take ( they say ) 10 days for them to receive a return? Once Collect+ have scanned the parcel, it's in their system, and they know they'll get their goods back. And again, another 10 days after the return to receive a refund? Why? If it's not them utilising the funds they've robbed from us then I don't know what it. If Amazon can process a refund within three days of acknowledging the return, why can't Asos? PLEASE PEOPLE: DON'T BUY FROM ASOS, THEY ARE SCAMMERS, YOU WON'T GET YOU GOODS AND THEY'LL KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.One last thing: how come Asos never bother to reply to ANY of the reviews? They simply don't give a damn, that's why......

            I left Asos for a while after a bad experience with Hermes never delivering my parcel next day and constantly lying, saying I wasn’t home. Anyway, I gave Asos another go. I shouldn’t have and I’m going to close my account today. Unfortunately Asos started using Hermes again and I think it’s pretty much a common knowledge now that unless you have an extremely conscientious local driver y will not see your parcel for roughly a week. Customer service says they have no way of communicating with Hermes and act like it’s nothing to do with Asos. Asos I have news for you! It’s everything to do with you because you contracted this hopeless courier! Anyway, to put the cherry on top of the cake, the customer service just ended the chat because they couldn’t be bothered to answer my questions anymore. If your orders are delivered by DPD you’ll probably be okay as long as you don’t need to contact customer services for any reason.

            Totally useless when you reach out to their customer services. They call themselves “customer care” but all they do is copy and paste pre-made answers that just make emails longer but with no solutions offered. I recently had a bad experience with one of my purchases, and asked for a goodwill gesture of a refund, however they kept refusing it because what happened wasn’t thei fault. However, the carrier delivered the parcel on a different day from what was said on the order, I wasn’t at home, they didn’t confirm my name and my coat got stole. They gave me a 10% discount to use for another purchase as their way to make it up, but since I had to refund the item due to wrong size, they refused to issue the 10% again, so it was a total waste.If you just shop, receive your items ok and send them back, then I guess it’s ok. But try to reach out for extra help to their “customer care” and all you get is a big headache and no solutions to your issues at all. Some items they sell are good, but with such a poor level of service I will refuse to shop there in future.

            If I could have given less than one star, I would have. Placed an order valued at over £100 and it was delivered to the wrong address. When telling ASOS about this they told us that it is a civil problem and we will need to find the parcel ourselves. No offer of replacements or a refund despite us mentioned that we are protected by the consumer rights act. Not that they were too bothered about that. They just kept sending the same pre-canned responses.I have asked to speak to a manager 3 times now and they aren't even acknowledging my request. I've been a customer of there's for years now and have spent thousands of pounds during this time. If this is how they treat loyal customers I can only imagine how they treat new customers!

            I’m shocked at all the bad reviews. I’ve had nothing but good service from ASOS. I get my clothes next day and returns have been super easy for me as I can differ in size, so sometimes I need to buy two of one thing to see what fits best.

            Im from Mauritius and must say a regular client to Asos. And i have not received my parcels many times but at the end had to keep on sending emails to get my refunds. I just found out that the standard delivery is now  £20. And i have to buy items up £200 to get free delivery to ship to Mauritius. I find this really ridiculous. Is that a new way to make money?  They could have put a significant sum like £30 - to £50  to obtain free shipping. Really disapointing!

            Lots of fake 5 star reviews praising this company, why isn't trustpilot cracking down on it?Ordered item via ASOS, was told it would arrive on Thursday I waited in all day and nothing arrived, checked hermes tracker who confirmed it was delivered to the warehouse. But no courier assigned. ASOS then tell me to wait until the morning as it will arrive tomorrow.Contact ASOS to complain again that the tracker wasn't updated to be told that hermes are having issues and my package is delayed for an additional 12 days, after I requested a refund.Reading between the lines it's been lost or stolen and they need to wait time until they can report the package missing leaving me without my order and out of pocket.Why oh why oh why is this company still in business?Spoke to customer support 3 times this morning requesting a refund and my complaint to be escalated to recieve blanket cut and paste responses from 3 different people reading off a script, ignoring my requests.Last time I order anything from this organisation, no concept of customer service and the countless complaints on here dont lie.

            Premium delivery is a scam!! Don't sign up for it! I paid for UK premium delivery and assigned a next day delivery to a London address. Not only they failed to show up, lied about re-deliver later the same day, they even deliberately changed the delivery day without my consent and sent me a notification to ""confirm my request to change the delivery date"" which request I've never made!! Custom service team is a joke, I cannot get any helpful advice. They literally told me, the delivery date is an estimated date, there's no guarantee. Then why on earth did you charge your customer more for ""premium delivery"", ASOS?? I like your clothes, but your service quality is unbelievable poor! Please train your staff well enough before start providing so called ""premium service""!!

            Shocking customer service!I order at least once a month. I ordered a couple of day ago for a couple of dresses. One of the dresses I ordered was a white dress with red roses. Came home to my parcels today to find the dress that arrived was incorrect it was the wrong colour, wrong fabric and wrong length. I contact customer service straight away and spoke to a very rude lady called Abby she told me I would need to send it back and if they had any of the correct dresses they would send me one alternatively I could just order the dress again! I was disgusted by her attitude as if everyone has loads of money laying around to just order however many they want. The only way I can now get the correct dress is to re order and pray the correct one shows. She informed me if I sent the incorrect one back they wouldn’t sort anything out as that’s not their job. It would be my responsibility to reorder. Lack of customer after care is paramount! Absolutely disgraceful!

            I used to spend well over a thousand pounds a year with this company and now only use in desperation. Even then the customer service is poor and they don’t deliver on there promises. DPD Forged my signature, advising they delivered my item and they had not. I was advised there was nothing that could be done, this is fraud and should be taken further. I most recently ordered next day as I paid to be a premier member. I tracked the item on the day and it said ASOS hadn’t delivered the parcel. Emailed customer service advising not to bother sending as they had ruined any chances of ke attending my event and to refund me. No response of course.  On the fourth day after ordering it arrived which made me extremely mad, I contacted the team only to be sent no apology or reseluyion apart from to take time out of my day and petrol to return the item for a refund!

            I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews on here regarding delivery. I order from ASOS fairly regularly and always get my order either early or on time and returns are so easy and straight-forward.Generally, I'm very happy with my orders, although finding stuff that I like can be difficult. A lot of clothes are so close to being really nice but there's always something a little off. It could be anything from extra ruffles or weird colours to a strange cut. Despite this I always find myself coming back to see what's new and I generally find their simpler clothes to be quite nice.I also primarily get my jeans from here although this can also be a bit dicey. I regularly order the Curve Ridley Jeans and I recently ordered 2 pairs - one dark blue wash and one a 'nanette darkwash', the dark blue wash fitted as normal but the nanette darkwash was very loose. They were the exact same style and size of jean but there was such disparity in how they fit, it was very strange. But I kept both and use the latter when I want a very casual outfit.If I could, I would give ASOS 3.5 stars, they're not quite at 4 or 5 stars given the outlined issues above.

            Fine when deliveries go to plan but so incredibly unhelpful when something goes wrong! You can only talk to them on social media or live chat so you have to wait ages for a response and then when you finally get it all they do is spout the same rubbish that is no help what so ever. I have premier service (cost £9.95) which guarantees next day delivery and they're saying for me to get back in contact with them if I haven't received the order 10 days after I ordered it. They refuse to cancel and refund the order or reissue the products

            Ordered express shipping but their iPhone app glitched (while checking out with Apple Pay) and it processed with standard shipping, meaning my items wouldn't make it in time for a friend's birthday. Brought it up with staff who at first didn't believe I had even ordered anything because they couldn't find my order in their system. When they finally found it, they were completely unhelpful and blamed me for not selected the express shipping method - which I carefully explained was not presented to me due to a bug with their app. I asked for an immediate refund and to cancel my order, which they refused to do as ""it was not possible"", even though they hadn't shipped it yet.My only option was to order the same items again with Express postage, and refund the first delivery when it finally arrives.

            Order number 380216326: I ordered £121 worth of clothes from ASOS, I did not allow parcels to be left in a safe place in my settings as I live in a block of flats and it’s not secure. My order arrived at 13.25 on a Monday whilst I was at work, nobody was at home however it was marked as signed for by me. An obvious lie. No sign of the parcel, I checked with my neighbours and any “safe place” they may have put it, still no parcel. I got in touch with customer care who said they’d take it up with DPD and would take 3-5 working days. A week goes by and I receive no update so follow it up myself, they say that the parcel was delivered correctly. I ask to see the signature and they send it across, literally a scribble, not my signature. I reply telling them this. They refuse to take it any further and say the case is closed. I am extremely frustrated with the customer service, they have not listened to me and not done all they can. I do not trust Asos delivery and customer care now and will no longer be using their service. They even got my name wrong in the email where they said  “I understand how frustrating this is on your end and I can assure you that we are constantly changing and trying to improve the service we provide for the people that are most important to us and that is certainly you Leah. I can also see that through our investigation that DPD has done all the relevant investigation which has now been closed and so we are confident that it was delivered.” My name is not Leah.

They simply copy and paste the same generic vague response over and over again that doesn't even come close to answering your question.  After 4 emails sent with the same response I had to type an email in capital letters to have them actually read what I was asking them.  Even then, they took almost 2 weeks to respond after having to follow up yet again only to have them come to the same conclusion that I'm able to to return my ill-fitting items for a flat fee that they seemed to have just made up as no delivery service has been able to quote me this price. Don't let the website fool you with the bold print going across their landing page saying ""Free returns"".  This is untrue.  Also don't believe what they state as the flat return shipping cost for Canada.  This is also untrue.  Also  had to pay a significant duty fee for their ""Free Shipping"" as well which they don't quote you for or even mention as something to expect when putting your order in.It is truly despicable the kind of service they deliver for an online retailer.

            Surprised to see how many low reviews here - personally, I have been shopping with ASOS for more than a year, and this has grown to become my go-to place for online shopping, and they always manage to have anything I am looking for. On top of this, shipping is insanely fast. If there's a huge sale though (e.g. Black Friday), expect a slight delay, which I have experienced. But other than that, I'm impressed with the quality, service and shipping speed - most of my orders have arrived 3 days before the expected delivery date, which keeps me coming back to shopping with ASOS as well.Based on my experience so far, I recommend shopping at ASOS, especially when it comes to their sales.

            A firm lover of ASOS!It’s the first place I go if I want some new clothes or need a specific outfit for an event. Yes you pay for your clothes but the clothes you receive are always good quality. Fast delivery every time I purchase, and always comes well wrapped in the traditional ASOS packaging. I look forward to receiving a purchase and I also enjoy that they enable you to pay later which I’ve used a fair amount of times and never had a problem with :)

            It is actually pretty great.There's little to go wrong. The courier once delivered my parcel to someone else without trying to deliver to me first even though I was at home he didn't bother ringing the bell, but that's just Hermes being... Well, Hermes.Customer service at Asos is not so polite as other places, I found some customer service representatives via chat being less than patient and get irritated rather quickly. Nevertheless of course they still tried to help.I never once had to call this company but I found it annoying how they made it so hard to just email them without going through the stupid online form, honestly. Provide all your details as a company and us customers won't be so dramatic!In terms of delivery they are super quick it's amazing and returns as well they are amazingly fast. Using Klarna with this company is the cherry on cake!! Can't-stop-shopping!!

            I pay an extra £9.99 per year for next day delivery. Most of the time my orders arrive in the allotted time. However when they don't their customer service are lacking in empathy and do not help to solve the problem. Delivery time today between 10-12pm its now 15:13 and no parcel. Asos customer service tell me to wait until tomorrow to get in touch. Not really good enough when I need the item TODAY.

My 1st order was sent out wrong size and wrong color. I reached out to ASOS by instant messenger chat and that got me nowhere also tried thru email the same results.  Customer service is poor & since ASOS does not provide a toll free customer inquiry or customer service line - Your Ship out of luck!!!

            I don't usually write reviews but saw so many bad ones so thought I should share my experience. I've ordered off ASOS a few times and never had any issues before but the most recent order that I placed I had delivered to my local parcel shop, the order said it had all arrived but yet when I received it half was missing. I opened an online chat with someone who passed my case onto a specialist and said they would be in touch within 24 hours (after reading the bad reviews I was very scared I would not received my items at all) . 2 hours later I had been contacted by email to apologise for the delay and that I would have the rest of my items dispatched with next day delivery. The items arrived next day as stated and all my items were there. Yes, there was a little glitch to begin with but I can honestly say it does not put me off using them and I will certainly be buying the delivery pass in future!

            I live overseas and ordered a new bikini for my first proper holiday in 10 years. When the order arrived, they had sent me two bikini bottoms, instead of the top and bottom. The bottoms costs 30% less than the top. I contacted ASOS via their website and was told I would have to send the bikini bottoms back before they would send out a replacement. Or order again and wait for my order to come and then wait for my refund. I could not get anywhere with customer service. They just point blank refused to send a replacement and I did not have time to return them. Poor show ASOS, I have been a customer of yours for many years.

            Ordered a pair of $300 shoes which were in stock on their website. Received the package two days later, with the correct shoe box, correct shoe tissue but absolutely the wrong pair of shoes. When I contacted customer service they offered me a refund if I return the shoes and free shipping if I reorder. Will have to wait almost 1 month for refund because they packed a Parcel Return Label for USPS for returns (which could take 2 weeks to arrive) and it takes 10 days after they receive to issue a credit/refund. Literally the refund and free shipping are already parts of their service as I didn't pay for shipping when I ordered the item. Customer service is unable to provide any retaining value. I'm 100% expecting them to refuse my refund after they ""investigate"" at which time I will be seeking punitive measures. Literally save yourself and do NOT ORDER FROM THIS UNTRUSTWORTHY COMPANY.

            I received a gift voucher as a birthday present. After searching for months for something I could by it was so much hassle trying to put all my details in and for them to accept the voucher. The order was then placed and was due to come on Thursday. I woke up on Thursday and then record an email stating that my parcel had tried to be delivered but no one was in. This was false as I definitely was in and no slip had been put through the door like they would normally do. I reached out to ASOS on 2 live chats and both showed very very poor customer service, the first blamed me for this and the second one stated that my parcel was still to come- neither of them took any responsibility for the fact I got an email confirming that my parcel had tried to be delivered, all I wanted to know was what happened and when it would be coming. Customer service is very poor and I still haven’t received my parcel. Will not shop from here ahain

            The most impersonal and lazy customer service I have ever had. I used the online chat, there was 5 minutes between me typing and them replying which made me feel that my complaint didn't matter from the get go. To top that off I was told I had to wait until midnight for my delivery and only after then when it definitely hadn't been delivered on that day could they engage in a conversation with me about where my order was. I felt like I was either being lied to or dismissed the whole time. In addition to this when I followed up for a refund on my next day delivery I was told they would look in to it and get back to me, I can't comprehend that their system is so complicated to use that they can't see within seconds whether the delivery arrived the day it was meant to. In addition to this when I asked to escalate my complaint and receive a call back from a manager to discuss customer service experience, I was redirected to emailing them (as if I hadn't already contacted them several times) and then not even given the email address? Honestly need to pull their finger out, ASOS website is great but as soon as there's an issue you'll wish you never shopped there. Will be going straight to actual retailers going forward. Spent 19 minutes today on their chat service, all to be told ""we will look in to it"", took me less time to write this review...

            I have used Asos for years without an issue. The first time I ever had cause for complaint I contacted their ‘customer service’ team and was constantly talked over, sighed at and cut off. Nothing was followed up and I had to contact them over 20 times for the issue to finally be resolved. Asos have serious problems when it comes to customer service. Whilst the shopping experience is great, they need to focus on improving their customer service. I would recommend anyone to make any complaint you might have via ‘Resolver’. Once I logged my complaint through this, I finally gained a satisfactory resolution.

            ASOS has a obligation to give you, as a paying customer, an estimate cost of customs and duties when a product that you have ordered is being imported into Canada. I was charged $43.00 on a $94.00 dress, plus $15.00 shipping. I had NO idea it was going to cost $43.00 to import a cheap dress into Canada. I work with customs brokers every day, and there is no way it should cost that much. Just to recap: $53.00 to get a $94.00 dress across the border from the US to Canada. What's funny is that I do a lot of cross-border shopping, and it has NEVER cost that much for duties and taxes to import products into Canada. I'll never shop with them again. Absolute crooks. Even when I chatted with them to see what the deal was, they blamed it on Canada's import charges. Well that's bullsh*t. They should have the estimated cost of import duties listed before completing your order so you can make the choice if you want to order a cheap dress from ASOS, or a decent quality dress from somewhere else for less money. Shame on you ASOS. What a rip off. And the best part? You have to pay it all over again to return the item! Maybe be honest explain to your customers the COMPLETE cost of ordering from your company, rather than surprise them with costs that they should have known they were going to have to pay.

I contacted customer service for a replacement and all they did was to paste some irrelevant generic info. I had to return the item for a replacement or refund. That means I have to pay transportation and send an empty box back to them. Unacceptable services. P.S. The customer service chat is the most awful I've ever encountered. They couldn't wait to shut down the chat box.

            The moment a product goes on sale (i.e.- when it is closer to the real value, because let's face it, ASOS stock poor quality items most of the time) it sells out almost immediately and is never restocked.

            I was once a loyal ASOS customer for three years and was on the A-LIST top-tier membership for the entire time until they closed the membership programme earlier this year. This year I purchased next-day delivery service, and this has proven as one of the greatest mistakes I have ever made.Spending £9.99 for the so called 'Next-day delivery' and have two deliveries out of three never arrived on the next day. Contacted customer service online and all that I received were copy-and-paste canned templates that were irrelevant.And then this staff, who referred herself as 'Imani', should be awarded the best employee of ASOS. I witnessed the best way to deliberately shut customer up when there is anything out of competency :'As I have advised all I can I will now go ahead and close the chat.'Unbelievable.I was in the Customer Service sector and I can admit that I once thought I was talking to scammers here. All that I have experienced have violated the big no-nos of the CS profession. I am shocked to see a big e-commerce like ASOS would allow such service standard as if I was in a random deep web merchandising.To ASOS management (if there is even one) - I do not know how much you paid your online CS that made them treat customers like that - Hopefully not, but I wouldn't be surprised, if the people I was speaking with were some high school part-time who did not even know how to deal with problems in the real world of work.

            Terrible company. Wanted ridiculous forms of ID in order to buy a £10 gift card with my Paypal account. They didn't tell me this until several hours later, by which time it was too late for the gift card to be still given as a gift anyway.I tried to get them to explain why over several emails: I received a mixture of bot responses, canned responses that were not relevant, and responses that refused to acknowledge the problem or explain it.I was eventually told that further emails would be ignored and then deactivated my account. And no, I was not rude in my correspondence as you might assume.

            I have ordered from ASOS a few times now and a part from a few late orders I’ve never had a problem. Earlier this month I made an order on this website and the estimated delivery was 12th January. On the 13th I tried to track my order due to it being late and it could not find it. I emailed and messaged them on Twitter to inform them. Finally on the 18th January I got my parcel in the post. But when I came to open it I realised it was not ge order I made. I informed ASOS right away to let them know I was dissappionted with this service. I received a reply to say I’d have to return this order and I would get a full refund but I would not get my correct order in return because they would have to look into this. I felt that I had to go out of my way to return this product for a mistake they had made. I will not be ordering from ASOS again.

            I would not even rate asos 1 star! Their customer service is disgusting!!! When things goes wrong they are the absolute worst company EVERRRRRR to deal with. One month today I made an order next day delivery in which the DPD driver delivered to the wrong address. I informed both companies to be told conflicting information and lies especially from ASOS. No effort to resolve it and yet a month later I still have not been issued a refund, even though they are more than aware that the parcel had not been received by me. To make it worst I was told a couple of days ago it had finally been sorted and an issue refunded to find out today they had no record of this and it would yet again take a further 24hrs to be dealt with within the refunds department. I have been told nonsense for the past month. I have never experienced anything like it!! So annoyed because they sell amazing stuff, but it’s really not worth the stress when it goes wrong!!

            I fundamentally disagree with ASOS decisions in my case. They have refused to acknowledge that items were missing when they delivered the bag falling to pieces. and have made the decision to stop replying to emails from me because they have closed my account, despite me ordering from them on many occasions and also when that is not conducive to resolving the issue. The bag was split when it arrived, as I noted with yourself and the driver, and yet I am being penalised for ASOS packing the bags too heavy and for disregarding your poor customer service in resolving the issue. I am not in any way a liar and I am extremely disappointed with the situation. The items may be elsewhere in the delivery network but they have done nothing to check this and have placed sanctions on my account that are uncalled for, unexpected and downright unfair. I feel completely victimised by their errors and I will be taking this complaint further with further negative reviews online, with my credit card issuer, Hermes and the ombudsman.

            Love ASOS and use them on a regular basis. £10 for all year round next day delivery is a bargain and they have a huge selection of products to choose from that I don't need to leave the house for. As a busy customer with little time for getting to a major city to spend the day walking round stores this is ideal. Had 1 issue on a delivery in about 12 years and ASOS sent a replacement order (although the service was a little slow on this). However mistakes happen and if it one in 100 orders then I don't have an issue. Bought plenty of ASOS own label stuff too which are normally a great price too. Quality not the same as designer, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Stock plenty of brands too from high street to your Ralph Lauren's etc

            They suspended my account because I inquired about a return. One was processed in a timely manner, the other was not and when I inquired about this they kept saying ""wait 12 days.. wait another 12 days etc.. a member of our specialist team will get back to you"" and of course no one ever does. They also closed the chat window on me numerous times and said there is nothing they can do for me. How about investigate? I proceeded to reclaim my money through my credit card company and then funnily enough, my return was suddenly processed. I let me credit card company know that I finally received my money back. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I ever had. They send canned messages and provide no help or look into your account at all. I have a voucher to use at ASOS (that I wanted to use up and then be done with the company), but strangely every time I place an order, it gets cancelled. I think they banned me. All because I inquired about a lost/delayed return. Horrible company with unethical business practices. How they are still in business is very puzzling to me. I have been a loyal customer, spending thousands for nearly a decade and this is how they treated me.

            Last two orderers I placed were delivered to an old address, despite me checking to ensure my current delivery address is inputted. Thus, the second order I made I checked 3 times to ensure that the address was correct, and even deleted the old one from the website AND made my new address the default one. Despite this, the parcel was delivered to the old address and I had to waste time and money on travel to collect it myself! When speaking to a member of customer services called Callum, I was made to feel stupid, even though I am 1000% sure it was not my error on either of the occasions. I have always been a loyal customer, but I am more than disappointed, especially at how customer services have treated me, completely dismissing my query (despite explaining very thoroughly that there was NO WAY that my device inputted the wrong address since it is not saved on it). I even did some searching online and other people have had the EXACT same issue. Still, I was met with a blatantly copied and pasted response from above stating that it was not their fault, and therefore implying that I am either lying or simply stupid. EXTREMELY disappointed with the lack of help I received and will most definitely will be contacting the head office to complain. Unacceptable treatment of customers.

            ASOS needs more transparency in their ordering process. They claim they offer tracking but all I get is a vague delivery estimate and a ""click here for live updates"" that leads to a page of general shipping information. It seems designed to dupe you and I feel like a fool for ordering from them not just once but twice. Especially since their website doesn't allow product reviews. I received the second order today and the product is nice, but I didn't expect to get dinged with an $18 customs fee when my order was <$70. Still waiting on the first order placed almost a month ago and scared of how much I'll have to pay on that. This website is probably worth the hype if you live in the UK or anywhere they cater to better than here. When it comes down to it, I could have spent the same amount at higher-end Canadian stores instead of trying to find deals online!

            Asos shoes never fit properly and they never leave enough room for a comfortable fit. I ordered boots from them which were wide fit. They were comfortable but very narrow around the toe area as if the shoes were an exact size eight. There was not one millimetre of room to even wriggle my toes. They do this every time with their own brand shoes and boots the sizing is very poor. I would have had to buy a size 8.5 or 9 for them to be a decent fit. The price they charge for their own brand shoes is not reflective of the poor fit and poorer quality of their footwear. This time I really will stop buying their footwear and stick to other brands.

I then got a chat associate on the line a few days later that I asked for a refund. This associate fobbed me off to a ‘specialist’ (delivery team) who re-sent the order without checking with me. I wanted to cancel and refund the order. I then received progressively rude emails from a number of associates when I’d asked for a manager to resolve this. They seemed annoyed that I wouldn’t just go away. Worst customer service ever. They then went on to tell me that it was ‘my responsibility’ to return the parcel. Awful.

            I have order multipule time with Asos previously. They are on the whole, fast and effective with their service and sell good quality items both from their own range and others.However, when delivery goes wrong their service collapses. It’s coming up to a month after my next day delivery parcel was ordered. After reviewing no answer from my DPD parcel search past the “5 working day” limit, Asos have failed to give me the refund I asked for. Now I don’t think this is the kind of service a loyal customer deserves. It may not be their fault entirely, but their efforts to accept the parcel was lost and give me a refund was questionable.

            I spent £100 on ASOS and used next day delivery. Unfortunately, my order never arrived and DPD claim that it was signed for (which it wasn't as I wasn't home). At first, ASOS appeared really helpful, but as DPD continued to claim it had been delivered, ASOS merely apologised and said there was nothing they could do. Really disappointed that ASOS have let a loyal customer take the fall for their (and DPD's) failure to deliver. Absolutely useless.

            NO AMERICAN SHOULD BE PURCHASING FROM HERE.Customer service is absolutely horrible. I followed directions for the return and sent it via US Post with their return label, and they refuse to assist me on refunding my money. I thankfully purchased through PayPal, but I'm doubting they will assist me. This company has not been helpful whatsoever, accusing me of keeping item and trying to get money back. I could never do that. I wanted the boots so bad, but they just didn't fit me. Now it's been over a month, and I'm out $150. I highly recommend staying with American companies and bypassing this one.***Update: got PayPal involved and they decided in my favor. Received full refund back ***

            I made an order last night and I entered in a valid 15% off promo code that was available until Jan 17 2019. I contacted the customer rep telling her that my offer said it was applied to the order, however when I got a text from DHL to pay for my customs fee $82 (because I live in Canada), I reviewed my order and the code was not applied. The customer rep told me nothing could be done at this point and my only option is to resend the package back (would be about $50)and replace the order. I’ve never received crappier service than from ASOS. This will be my first and last time ordering from them.

Contacted asos told them I'd  like to cancel the order and just want my money back. Live chat customer service was appalling and email was even worse.

            I have shopped with ASOS around 3 times. No bumps in the road ever and I live in Australia. I guess I’m one of the lucky ones judging by the other reviews! Items are true to size, and fabrics are good (if you’re specifically looking for them- so many polyester and other synthetic fabric items). Items wear for a long time. Only thing is express shipping takes a week if not more. Too long for express.

            Very disappointed with ASOS customer care. This Christmas Season i decided to purchase some friends gifts from ASOS and as it seems it was a very big mistake. One of the gifts was a Candlelight scented candle which arrived in a small carton box with a relevant label confirming that it was just that. So, i did not bother to open it and gift wrapped it and gave it to my friend yesterday when i got the chance to see her. To my surprise in the box there was no Candle, just a coffee mug with the letter ""C"" printed on it, even though the box still stated otherwise and the order was not that mug. In any case i told my friend to keep it since it was a gift and that i will be contacting the customer care to let them know of what happened. To my surprise and even though i had explained the situation to the customer representative and also supplied the necessary evidence pictures, i was requested to ask for the gift back!!! and to return it in order to get a refund. Note that the whole value of the item is just a few pounds, so who would actually go through the process of asking a gift back just to get a refund?!? I was expecting a much better approach from a store which claims to be market leader in Europe and also taking responsibility about their mistakes is not optional especially in cases where the fault is clearly an internal error!! There are online companies out there with much customer care and i'm sorry this is what ASOS has become!!

            Always been pleased with asos’ quick delivery times and low prices. Their in house items are also very reasonably priced and good quality (minus the tracksuit bottoms which are pretty awful, everything else has been very good though). Some of these other people need to be reasonable and not expect big gift cards every time something is delayed or something similar (which isn’t often.) you’re already getting free returns and FREE next day delivery for a year for under £10. Never received a damaged item either. They’re also very lenient with their returns, unlike some others. Don’t listen to some of these reviews bashing them about it, I get the feeling they’re the sort to order 10 items, return 9, 3 weeks later after wearing them and then complain that they’re not accepted for being worn, damaged, stained etc. If this is your first time ordering from ASOS you won’t be disappointed.

            Horrendous customer experience. The customer care team are not aligned, they don't speak to each other - you'll get one reply off one of the team, then another one will message you with different information an hour later. The past few parcels I've ordered have been either damaged, late or lost. They don't have direct communication with any of their couriers which as a result means parcels don't turn up - ASOS try to blame the couriers but then the couriers blame ASOS. Majority of products are not worth the money. The only saving grace is free returns.

            Really nice clothing but they don't care of their customers. I paid for the 1 day premium delivery and from many order almost none of them came on time. Customer care NEVER offers anything more than ""sorry"" even if t they don't deliver the package for many days or simply don't deliver because the item was out of stock (even though there was no information in the order status whatsoever). All in all the experience is really disappointing.

            It would be great to see ASOS improve their consistency in the customer service. All I was looking for was a member of the ASOS team to re-arrange a delivery with their delivery provider (Gnewt), after one my packages was sent to the incorrect address which I picked by mistake. Firstly, using the online chat portal, I had to get in contact three times in one day for the following reasons:The first time (Friday 4th) it created a chat box with my old email, even though I was logged into my account with my current email. This might be a cookie refresh issue. I was told to log out and create a new ticket with my new email, even though I could fully provide any authentication on my end.The second time, having logged out and made a query passing my email in, I was told I'd get a phone call to assist me with my problem (arranging a re-delivery with Gnewt). I never got called.The third time, a few hours after I was told I'd be called, I got in contact again and received the same response, that I would be getting a phone call. I never got called.On Sunday, I then decided to get in contact with the social media CS (Facebook messenger), where my chat history is visible to read through by your team. I was told without a chat reference I could not be helped, which somewhat defeats the point in having a customer services portal on Facebook at all. When asked whether I could create a new query (and ignore the previous experiences on Friday), I was replied to with a copy-paste response of what was said before, essentially dismissing my response. It was rude, unhelpful and made me feel ignored and disrespected as a customer, especially as one paying for their next-day delivery service.Only after submitting a feedback claim that evening illustrating my frustration did I get help, which was actually solved very quickly on Monday. That was very helpful, although it made me wonder why that could not have been done first thing on Friday, rather than make me go through what I went through over the weekend. My request was not complicated, and easy to resolve, and yet it took 3 online CS staff, who knows how many Facebook Messenger CS staff and one official feedback submission to get someone on your end to action my query. This is pretty terrible on ASOS' end, and means I won't be renewing my next-day subscription as I ultimately had the experience of someone who had a delayed and problematic delivery with terrible support.The solution to my problem was not complex, and yet it took an insane amount of effort to resolve. I was unable to edit the order as the 15-minute window to edit next-day orders had elapsed by the time I realised I had picked the wrong address (ordered some other stuff to the correct address later that day). If ASOS are going to be cutting off order edits after that short window maybe I'd recommend they ensure their CS system has basic competency to handle issues like this in the future.

            Watch out! If you complain about a missing item they suspend your account & charge you for your items. I received one out of three items and sent them an email and this was their reaction. No one spoke to me. All cut and paste replies with no reasoning behind their descion. Shopped with them for 6+ years with no problem and liked their service before.I’m £100 out of pocket and spent the day really upset at the tone of their email (accusing me of fraud)I’ve heard their doing badly financially, so think this is their way of clawing back profits - refusing to refund people.Be aware before you order.

            I’ve sent back 3 coats now as they are nothing like they appear to be on the pictures. I have one coat that I bought years ago which admittedly is lovely and I got that fed up sending back coats I just ordered the same one but in a different colour. The reason I ordered it was because the hood is beautiful. Not this time! It’s half the size , terrible faux fur and nothing like the picture. I found that really odd considering it’s the exact same coat just a different colour. I’ve emailed again and again but all they keep saying is send it back. All 3 coats have been a waste of time and disappointment. ASOS you are falsely advertising with completely different images. It’s misleading wasting customers time and money. A reputable company should never do this and find a resolution compensating the customer at all times. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.

            Mostly good experiences with Asos but have had some less good ones too. I have experienced quite a few times that when I order express delivery that the items arrive faulty and they promise to return the shipping as well as the cost of the clothes which is fair, but they did not return the shipping of 110DKK twice when this happened. So in fact they owe me 220DKK. I just let it this go because it became too energy consuming to email them back and forth about it as they claimed they had already returned me the money. I am not ordering on express delivery anymore that seems to eliminate this problem.Free shipping and returns are really great. At times it's annoying that one has to go and print out returns labels and that they aren't provided with the items in the parcels but it's better than having to pay.Shipping and returns can be a bit slow. Love their clothes, good brands, good prices and well displayed with videos that help you decide if you want to purchase it. :)

            I guess the bad part about this company is the customer service. My order was on time, right size (as ordered), looked just like the picture, it was what the description said and it was 70% off. I had it delivered to the USA and chose 2 day delivery and it got here 5 hours before scheduled.

            Garbage return instructions. Handed return package to mail man and apparently I needed a receipt of some sort to show proof of shipment after discovering that the package hasn’t even left the states after 2 weeks of me handing the package over. They have no serial number on these prepaid labels so my package got lost somehow due to a failure in establishing an “activated” shipment and I only have my name and return address to work with in attempts towards locating the thing at the Post Office. I’m sure once I locate it it will also conveniently fall beyond the return date deadline since being MIA. The reps tell me I’m SOL now and both blatantly ended the chat convos before I could gather more info.. Really disappointing turn of events so I think I’m also done with ASOS. I shouldn’t have had to experience this. Bottom line.

            ASOS has terrible customer service. Or, I should say, they have terrible policies. The return policy is great if you want to return something you bought for a refund, but forget it if you want to exchange or get gift credit for something that was purchased as a gift. And worst of all, their gift cards EXPIRE. If you’re shopping from the US, it’s very difficult to use them because you have to shop in GBP rather than USD, and after two years, they expire. I lost hundreds of dollars this way.

            Absolutely appalling service! it was my last time with this retailer. Order no 380443090, paid for the next day delivery 6 pounds extra to receive it on 4th. Waited the whole day only to find out how atrocious and cunning people working for DPD are (courier didn't arrive, later they lied about attempting to deliver). Then it was 5th that I was supposed to get my order but then again - nothing happened, no courier, tracking showed my parcel was at their depot. Spent 1h on that asos chat talking to 3 people and not only they (still) don't know when my order is going to be delivered, on top of that they're consistent at refusing to reimburse me with that 6 quid I paid extra for alleged next day delivery which turned out to be joke. Today is 7th and my parcel is still at DPD's depot.

            Dear all,Please read the review before you buy something on Asos.I bough some staff there on Nov 18.I supposed to get my staff by Dec 6 how it was said on my account.From Dec 6 i checked my post office almost every day and didn't get anything.I called them as well yesterday, nothing.Asos, you support team is terrible.They told me to wait till Dec 26.I waited.Then again wait, wait.Then i said that i needed my money back, they said check you custom office and so on....Just wasting time.Then they made their investigation and off course they were right and not responsible for anything.Guys, even when i buy some staff from China, they give my a track number even if i pay $10, i can track my order.You - nothing.No track number for free delivery.Common.....I've sent a request for charge back....People, don't buy from them.......0 stars here............

I've purchased more than ten times with Asos in 2018.

            Purchased from asos.com a couple of times before without problem. ASOS design is relatively cheap, but you also get a little less quality than what you pay for (despite the lower price). However, customer service is horrific when there is a problem with products or deliveries. I recently purchased a pack of 2 pairs of shorts, 1 pair is missing on delivery. Wrote to customer services, they asked me to return the pair that I received and then I MIGHT get the refund, then I MIGHT be able to reorder them on line. Meanwhile, they are stil selling a single pack of the same shorts on line, but they refused to replace it. There is supposed to be a replacement policy if an item is missing, however, it is considered as a faulty product in my case, hence, replacement policy does not apply. (The most frustrating thing is that they kept refering it as an MISSING item in our numerous emails until I asked for a replacement, then it suddenly became a FAULTY item.) Has anyone had SIMILAR experience?

            Very poor experience. Avoid ASOS as there are so many other online retailers that provide much better experience.Returned faulty goods and ASOS refused to replace the item at the original purchase price, expecting me to repurchase at the higher sale price. Very poor service.

            If I could give zero stars I would! I ordered a large order from Asos.com on November 11th which I was not informed by their site that because the order was over $800 would not be eligible for their pre-paid customs which a policy that recently changed.This shipment then got stuck in customs for 10 days where I would talk to Asos on their customer service chat or email and they would tell me to talk to the shipper, UPS, but when I would call UPS they told me the paperwork was incorrect and Asos did not give them a tax ID and that Asos would need to correct the situation to get this released from customs. Asos customer service was absolutely no help whatsoever and eventually after speaking with UPS several times I was able to have them release the shipment to me by providing my personal Tax ID. THEN when the package finally arrived on 12/6 (I had paid for 2-3 day expidited shipping) UPS came to deliver the packages and would not release them to me unless I gave them my credit card to the delivery man to charge me over $1200 in duties!!! Outrageous, so I refused the order.On 12/20 it had been two weeks since I refused shipment and sent my packages back to Asos on 12/6. So I emailed their customer service to find out when I will be refunded. They told me the shipment is still in transit and it should reach their warehouse by 12/28.Now I have just emailed them again and they told me they will receive the shipment in another 14 days and that it will then take 5-10 days for refund.After many emails back and forth with customer service, which every time seemed to be a different person that did not read or understand at all the previous email communications regarding this issue they kep apologizing that I have not yet received my package and offered no help, no explanation and no shipment tracking so that I can track the package myself to see when it will arrive at their warehouse.It has now been well over 6 weeks since I placed the order and I have had no choice but to report this to my credit card company as fraud.

            Made an order to be delivered for Christmas, paid for next day delivery, they never arrived and have had trouble getting in contact with anyone. Got an email today thanking me for returning the products with no explanation, I’ve been in contact again and have been informed I’m not getting refunded for the £5.95 delivery I paid for, only the products inside. After contacting them asking why I was not getting a refund for the delivery, I have been informed I will get a refund for the full amount paid, why I wasn’t going to get refunded for delivery anyway I don’t know.  Customer service has really been disappointing and I’ve felt as if no one I’ve spoke to had cared at all. Now I’ll have to buy more Christmas presents!! Won’t be buying from them again.

            I've been a customer of ASOS for years regularly spending £££'s but I won't be spending another penny there. Ordered a pair of Ted Baker trousers for a night out and paid £6 for next day delivery. As I was putting an order in anyway I chucked a pair of shoes in my basket as well. They accepted my order and sent me a dispatch notification later that evening. Ten minutes AFTER the dispatch notification they sent me a 2nd email saying the trousers, the only reason I'd made the order,  were not in stock! It then took me 3 weeks speaking to some of the rudest customer service personnel I've ever encountered, who by the way told me I couldn't speak to a supervisor or make a complaint, to eventually get a refund.I remember when their staff couldn't be more helpful, absolute joke now. Steer clear.

            Never had an issue with ASOS before. Really disappointed! Ordered suede shoes for my boyfriend a week before Christmas. Was told I’d get it on the 23rd December. It was late. Was then told I’d get it on New Year’s Eve. Once again nothing. Nearly two weeks later I was told to expect it soon and now today I’ve been refunded as they don’t even have the item in stock! Was the item even sent out time in the first place ??? Considering this was a Christmas present as well. I could have ordered from somewhere else in enough time if I wasn’t being led on for an extra two weeks! Really disappointed! Didn’t even have a decent excuse or reason why my order didn’t turn up. Will not be ordering from here again.

ASOS then messaged me saying your order will be with you soon why !!!?? I had already said I didn't need it I had to go out on Xmas Eve and replace what was missing !! then the replacement turned up exactly the same !!! because it hadn't been packed properly !! in exactly the same flimsy box !!!! with items missing yet again I contacted ASOS again to say what's happened they said they will get back to me ... well I've just received an email saying it's rare to have any items lost in the post they will not refund my money and I'm not aloud to order from ASOS anymore ?! and that all my emails will be blocked from the company .....ASOS did not send either packages in suitable PACKAGING ASOS AT FAULT i then asked for a refund instead ASOS RESENT ASOS AT FAULT then after all that I get an email basically calling me a theif and telling me I'm not allowed to order or even talk to ASOS in future  ...,.. this is my email to them

            The quality and consistency of sizing is terrible. Customers cannot post reviews of clothing, which makes you wonder why that isn't an option. I returned some clothing and will probably not see a refund on my account. I recommend shopping elsewhere even if you have to spend more money.

            Totally useless company, for some reason I decided to shop with them one last time and they managed to muck it up twice.The first time they stopped the order as Asos said they couldn't process my voucher, but took my money anyway. After a bit of back and forth with their useless customer services, they finally redeemed my voucher. I bought the item again and they delivered the incorrect size. So great, what a waste of time that whole saga was. I won't be shopping with them again.

            Always had great service from ASOS.  Unfortunately they're not great at refunding the correct items so I always have to check my refund emails thoroughly. However, when I do complain they are always quick to respond.

            Terrible.. I accidentally requested delivery of my items to my old address which was the default in my Asos account. As soon as I realised I could see the order was not dispatched and asked customer care to cancel the order so I could amend the address. They refused to cancel the order saying there is so many items in their warehouse they won't be able to find mine. As a supply chain manager myself I knew this was a BS answer. It was a genuine mistake. My old address was on the other side of the world and I had relocated from there over 12 months ago. Complete waste of good clothes

            I ordered a couple of items as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Delivery was promised by 17 December. On 18 December I contacted customer service to say that the parcel had not arrived and that i needed it for Christmas day. Customer service response was very poor saying that it was with the courier but that delivery could now only be made by 27th December. They also suggested I contact the courier as they did not have the ability to do so. Shocking . It is 27 December today and I have asked for a refund as I do not want the items after having purchased a replacement gift from another store- yet ASOS is not answering my question about a refund but asking me to wait. Appalling that they have taken my money and the goods are not to be seen. I will not be shopping with ASOS again and will be taking this to the consumer ombudsman if my refund is not forthcoming.

            Refusing to refund or communicate.Short version:I ordered a dress worth £99 in November I never received the dressASOS won’t comminicate with me or take any responsibility so I’m not being refundedLong version:I ordered three items including a dress for £99. When I got the items the dress wasn’t in the package, the package looked like it had been split. I told ASOS and they said they were looking into and would get back to me within 4 days.4 days later I’d heard nothing, so I emailed again they said it would take 5 days.5 days later I’d still heard nothing so I emailed again. They said they need to launch an investigation with DPD. I said I wanted my money back as I have nothing to do with DPD and they didn’t reply. A week later I emailed again asking for money back. They said they needed to wait to hear back from DPD?? So I asked if there was a time limit, ‘for example, if you don’t hear back from DPD for a year, will I still be waiting for my money back?’ Surprise Suprise...no reply. They don’t answer your questions they just regurgitate the same exerts from a script like:. ‘Once we hear DPD have resolved the investigation I will be back in touch.’

            When orders go well with ASOS they are brilliant. The second anything goes wrong the service completely evaporates and they are at a loss of what to do. I have an email chain 26 emails long relating to 3 orders that have been lost. 1 from the 5th December is still outstanding and customer services via email are repetitive and scripted giving no helpful information. Multiple requests to be called were ignored. The best that they can do is contact dpd again. The call centre are also on a script which makes dealing with them so frustrating. I do not even want the order anymore yet I’m expected to wait for dpd and ASOS to do an investigation which the result will no doubt be its lost.  For a company this size they really need to sort out their delivery and customer service.

I ordered 3 items around three weeks ago which never arrived at my home and no attempt was made to deliver to my house. They used the delivery company YODAL which potentially surpasses Asos in levels of incompetence. After lies, back tracking and more lies ASOS advised I should drive the 4 hour trip to pick them up myself. After declining this fantastic opportunity I was told to wait up to 2 weeks for a refund. Which was especially fantastic over the festive period.

            i ordered a pair of men's shoes for my son on black friday with an estimated delivery of approx. 5 business days. i received a notice that due to an airport delay, it would arrive about 3 days later.  The item i ordered was for Christmas, so it wasn't too big a deal.  When the item arrived, the shoes were damage (scratched) and dented.  i took photos of the item and started a chat with them because you can NEVER speak with a person. There is no phone number you can call to actually speak to a person! So they said they would send me out the correct pair and i could pay myself to return them and at some point would reimburse me for the shipping, What?  Just send me a return label! I am not going out of pocket to return your damaged item. So when the other shoe arrived, it was totally the wrong shoe.  it didn't even look like the shoe i ordered! Of course, i had to go back on chat and tell them of the situation.  I also took photos of the wrong shoe for them to review.  Now by this time its crunch time for christmas, so they told me there was nothing more they can do for me except to refund me the amount of the original purchase.  so i politely asked (on chat) what about the shoe i need for Christmas, are you going to send me the correct undamaged shoe that i have been waiting on?  I told them i would gladly return the ones they sent. i was instructed that i would have to pay again for the shoe i had already paid for and they would refund me once they receive the damaged one back. Wait, so i am paying twice and i still don't have what i ordered and of course they said it would not arrive in time for Christmas because yeah, you guys don't know how to process orders properly! Needless to say, i am putting these back in the mail and i told my son i would NEVER order anything else from this vile company.  i only gave it one star because i couldn't give it a zero.  Please keep your money from this scam company with no customer service!! VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER!!!

            I ordered a gift on December 16, paid $4 for shipping and it said it would arrive by Christmas eve. Late Christmas evening when it hadn't arrived, I contacted customer service being chat (as it is the only way to contact them) and was promised it would arrive by 10 PM or something could be done to compensate me. It did not arrive. I contacted customer service again and they told me to allow until JANUARY 7 for it to arrive. They would not even refund my delivery charge, and Christmas was ruined for my brother who did not receive a gift due to this error.Additionally, the track order link did not provide any information from my order. Amesha at customer service did give me the tracking information, but it wasn't available to me at the link provided. Their forecast delivery time was hugely optimistic to get here from Spain, as they sent it through the USPS normal mail.I will not buy from ASOS again, and I recommend expecting a very long delivery time if you do. From other reviews it appears paying more for faster shipping did nothing.Absolute joke.

            ASOS is a successful enough enterprise to process thousands of orders each day, most of which go perfectly well, and people don't tend to notice. It is only when things go badly that people decide they must voice their experience, which is understandable.I must therefore say ASOS is my most favoured shop! I have probably ordered about 100 items from them over the years, and have experienced problems on 1 or 2 occasions. Considering the amount of orders they process, it is naive to expect them to get it right every single time- unless you'd prefer humans removed and computers doing all the work instead?!GREAT company, wouldn't hesistate to recommend them for a second.

            ASOS might have the worst customer service of any company I've encountered. I ordered a dress for two holiday parties (my office party and my boyfriends). I ordered the dress on 11/30 and added $100 shoes to qualify for 2 day shipping. I didn't receive the dress for my boyfriend's work party and mine is tomorrow. It is now 14 days later and after three inquiry emails that were never responded to, I finally tried the live chat. Even though I was as polite as possible, Aliyah was short with me acting like it was my fault for not being patient and then when I asked ""so there is nothing you can do to help?"" She responded with ""We need to allow time for delays Ellie"" and ended the chat. Unbelievable!

So you’re having to return the item and reorder which at this point you’ve been put off from wanting the original item.  There is no logic at all in how Asos work. Why have an exchange option if not actually providing that service???

            So daughter wanted expensive watch, happy to buy, but would rather have given cash so she could buy in sales.  Daughter said no, so foolishly ordered off ASOS.Have annual subscription so came next day.Waited till she was open to open.  Wasn't happy at state of outer box (not main delivery box, but a small white one inside), but as solid MK box inside this, was happy enough.  Opened box to see what this £150 watch looked like and...nothing.  There was an instruction manual and the felt thing the watch sits on but some thief at the ASOS warehouse had successfully stolen the watch.Ok these things happen.  Really not happy but they happen.  Phoned 0207 756 1000 (for anyone else who wants to speak to someone) and was told they couldn't issue a replacement or refund until they had received the item (an empty box) back!  Demanded a manager callback, assured within 24 hours.  As surely proof I had sent the item back (CollectPlus) would be enough for them to issue a replacement.Multiple DMs on Twitter, where they asked what had happened and for proof I had sent back, etc, all supplied (including photo of empty box, packaging, ect)...Next day, another script monkey ignores what had gone on the night before and spewed the 7 day investigation, further 5 days for refund... and to be fair, lost it at this point!  It was when they said missing item and then as I had received the incorrect item!Was told if I swear again they won't help!  It doesn't actually matter that they weren't helping, just clutching at straws to pretend it was my fault!So in mid afternoon, called back again...Today's lie was timescale has gone from 24 hrs to 48 hrs!  Requested he go and check.  Tried to refuse.  Demanded he check that I was getting the callback that was agreed, came back and said no!

            Honestly some of the worst customer services I've had. Bought a pair of shoes expecting them to be here by Christmas as a gift. They arrived all right, with one shoe in the box! I contact them, explaining my situation and all they tell me to do is send them back. No offer to fix their mistake, but instead make an excuse that they're sold out (which they were not, since I had to shell out another 53 bucks to buy another pair), and that they cannot send them. I instead suggest compensation, maybe free two-day, something that will guarantee I get my order when I was SUPPOSED to. Nope. They say it can't be done, no explanation or willingness to make right on their shortcomings. Now I'm waiting until January sometime. I'll never buy anything from here again.ps: I ordered ONE item. One, and they got it wrong, if that gives you an idea about the amount of incompetence that goes into this company.

And if I’m not receiving the goods by January 4th than I can get In touch with asos again. Until then, my Christmas presents are obviously not deleivered, and I’ve wasted more time trying to come to a solution with these two incompetent and scamming businesses. I have no idea how they stay in business. This is the second time this happened to me. Asos and DHL both sell me a product t they can’t stand by- express shipping. I sigh the online waiver for signature release to leave my package at front door, while I am also home but I never get any DHL driver coming by because this is what they do. They lie that they drove around and didn’t find the client home. Asos online chat Gabrielle goes on to tell me that perhaps the driver didn’t deem it safe enough to leave the package at the front door....I feel completely insulted! It doesn’t matter if I live in the ghettos or if I live in the 2 million dollar house, as long as I signed the waiver Asos, let me the costumer make that decision! Whether is safe or not to leave my packages at the front door. Gabrielle’s response on deeming safe made insulted me and made me laugh at the same time. Purely incompetent, a loss of my time and money, no manager they could escalate this issue to, and their support consists of copy/paste of b-s policy every other two minutes when I keep insisting that I feel duped by them both , Asos and DHL. I have an email of the transcript conversation with this person at Asos and i’ll Make sure to post my review on every site on every continent for both Asos  and DHL. Asos and DHL CEO’s do you even read your costumers’ reviews on your companies? I guess not, because I wouldn’t imagine this far for your ignorance and greediness to go....Wish our system took a step in protecting the consumer but unfortunately we are on our own.....please don’t make the same mistake I did twice! Asos=Scam & DHL=Scam

            I actually love ASOS. The best variety of cloth and accessories. I only once had delay with shipping,for one day,but that was not a big deal.  I like that they have prepaid labels to return,no problems with refunds. You need to make sure what kinda brands you are buying ,cause some of them (pretty little thing) have the worst quality. I am able to buy cloth that is not available in US so I am very happy about it.

            History: Ordered Christmas gifts on 15th Dec, delivery scheduled for 17th Dec. Received email on 16th advising the order had been dispatched. Dissatisfaction: The order didnt arrive as advised, followed up with the customer care team on 18th Dec to be informed the matter had been passed to the “Specialist Team” and a response would be received within 8 days....... followed up again on 19th Dec and advised the order was Christmas gifts so waiting upto 8 days didnt make sense. Couple hours later received email stating “we’ve received your returned items”. Followed up again with the team and was told various different stories “items were out of stock”, “order couldnt be found in the warehouse” etc etc funnily enough a simple click back onto the website showed the items were in stock however funnily enough they had reverted back to their original prices (surprise surprise). Asked on multiple occasions for the matter to be escalated - however it seems apparently Asos do not have a dedicated complaints / escalations team as the Customer Care team handle such matters - this is questionable.Conclusion: The Customer Care team require training on what it actually means to “care” for customers. Also honesty is always the best policy.

            I am very unhappy with the level of service that I have received from ASOS and DPD, so I will review for both, I share this with you as I have just been sent an email from ASOS with lies. I will inform you of what I have so far experienced.I ordered Christmas gifts for my daughter from ASOS and designated my click and collect location. I am a Police Office working for the MET so I am limited on time due to dealing with criminals so click and collect is the obvious choice. Clearly not the case.After dealing with my arrest and case papers I Headed over to My click and collect location, as I received a message saying it had been signed for. However it was not there and was never sent there.After spending an age on the phone trying to get through to customer service I found out that the package is in BARKING ( WHY?) so I said I would collect it. I was then told that I could not as my name is not on the packages, DPD saying ASOS messed up. (was that also a lie? Was it even there?). Even though the  lady I spoke too was looking at my details on a computer screen knowing what my name is along with the reference number that is on the screen in front of her I would not be able to collect it.  Time out.........Logic, initiative, common sense, think outside the box........ Put my name on the box..... Screen in front says my name. I ordered it. It is for the said name on the screen. I am that person, get a pen and put my name on the package........... The Ref number is on the screen  and is linked to my name. Ok Logic is gone from this world. Too much time on phones, who knows turning into mindless robots.Long story short Dpd blame ASOS, ASOS blame DPD. I don't like playing the blame game, why don't they just talk to each other. As I was dealing with a Policing matter so I asked the lady from DPD nicely and calmly for her to email me with a solution as all I want to do is pick up my xmas gift for my daughter. She said she would email me at the email address that she had... and guess what?  yes under my name,I thanked her for her help, did she email me back that day? No. They are still blaming each other and not one has come up with a solution. I do not recommend ASOS or DPD.

            Finally have decided to order for the first time (to Russia). Got wrong shoe size. Support suggested I consult sizing chart as if it was my mistake and it was them mixing up UK and US sizes...ridiculous! Webpage, support - no help. Pointlessly waited for some dpt's response for 3 days re mistake... Eventually they've sent me a replacement order without my consent. And withheld money for the replacement item they've sent even when I've returned the pair I've initially received! All in all 2 months before I get my money back for a wrong sized pair!!!

            Hi am from mauritius. I had purchased several times on ASOS. But this will be the last time. I purchased one month ago and one of my order came with the wrong shoes size where on the box the size was correct. On a different order I brought a watches and when I received my parcel in mauritius it was empty. Only the ASOS box and the return policy paper was inside. Am very disappointed when u call or send mail they told u that they will look into and will refund but the refund never came. The watches I brought is amounting to 95gbp. Bad customer service

            I normally don't review websites I buy products from but looking at the volume of negativity that is completely opposite to my personal experience I feel like I should, not to say I think anybody is making up their experience, I am sure a lot of these negative reviews do have some credence but I have never experienced anything like that from ASOS. For example, I purchased a bag Wednesday evening using standard delivery (19th December) it has just arrived 5 minutes ago (21st December) so it would appear the delivery is very hit or miss as I am seeing volumes of people saying their order hasn't been dispatched 10 days after purchase.Overall in the 3 to 4 times I have used ASOS they have yet to disappoint me as they offer some of the best (if not the best) prices in the market, only thing I would say I do find mildly concerning is that the delivery (at least for standard) is by MyHermes and while they have done superbly the last 4 times, to say I have had a bumpy ride with them in the past would be an understatement so please do be cautious.

            I have ordered from Asos for years and never had a problem, but my most recent experiences with the company have been so bad that I had to write this review. I am a firm believer that - when something goes wrong you find out how good a company truly is.When my parcel didn't arrive I contacted Asos and was told my parcel had never left the warehouse. They said that they would replace my order or if the items were out of stock, provide a refund. A few days later a received an email stating that the items were out of stock so I would get a refund in 5-7 days. The next morning both items were in stock, however, they were no longer half price as they were when I ordered them some days before, they were now full price. Once again I called customer service, the advisor was rude and did not offer a solution, but instead said 'there is nothing we can do, I'm sorry"". When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told I would have to send an email in, I was adamant that I wanted to speak to someone and in the end, was offered a 24-48 hour call back. I have not received a callback and don't think I will. I will order from elsewhere in future.

The service desk is not responding and ending chats with me, and won't provide a refund!! I have asked to speak to a manager and was refused. I have seen many similar reviews saying the exact same thing. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE. I am going to Fair Trading for a refund.

            So stressed with ASOS! I've had years of positive shopping experiences with them but lately, for some reason, they have been a nightmare! No returns notes included in the parcels, incorrect refund amounts and what's worse is I am currently owed a total of £850 in refunds (from 3 orders) which should have been issued at the start of November! This is obviously the worst time of year that they could possibly mess me about and I am so stressed from emailing and receiving copied and pasted responses! I was made to provide them with statements evidenting 20 days after the date that each refund was processed so had to wait almost a month to get my monthly statement as Halifax wouldn't provide a statement mid term. I've provided this and now all I keep getting is a request for my November statement (sent 3 times already!) and screen shots to show that they have processed the refund. Seriously?! Give me strength!!!

            I have never really taken the time to write a review but I am so frustrated with this company. I ordered a Christmas gift December 10th, well in advance bc I know how holiday shipping is, and it was said to arrive the 18th. I looked at tracking and it has been “in transit” for 5 days... I emailed them and they sent me this generic reply telling me to wait until the end of the day... still never came. I emailed them this morning and they are now saying I won’t get my package until the 27th (after Christmas) it should not take 17 days to get a package... I would have never bought from this website if I knew this is how it would be. Don’t shop here if you want your items by a certain time!!!

            Bought a Christmas gift on Dec 10th for my Dad. Chased it a week later and tracking said that Hermes were still waiting for it. In my experience working with parcel networks this item is lost so I called and asked them to send a replacement. They told me they can't and won't do anything until 7 working days. This apparently works out that they won't take an action until the 24th Dec. As they're busy, they said it would also take 5-8 days to reprocess/deliver the reorder (a Christmas gift). Requested to cancel the order, as a Christmas gift on 2nd Jan is about as useful as a prophylactic sheath on a maternity ward. Conveniently they also can't cancel an order until 7 working days afterwards. Am now looking forwards to either cancelling the order or returning the item. Shocking festive experience.EDIT: Called on Christmas Eve as directed, told that they couldn't do anything until the end of the day at 10pm - advised to call bak on Boxing day.Called on Boxing day, jumper was delivered on 27th Dec. Gave to my Dad as a 2nd present, he likes the jumper.Slightly improved date, but review stays at 1* because I was messed around so much by customer services and the experience was poor, albeit nice clothing eventually received.

            I have spoken with two customer reps regarding an order in the past two days but they have been unable to resolve my issues.I originally ordered an item during the sale where it was £72.00 not £90.I ordered a size 14, but a size 16 arrived so I exchanged it for a 14. This was still far too big, so I sent back the 14 and ordered a 12. I am keeping the 12 as it was the only one that fit of the coats, and I did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back again so close to Christmas, despite the fact that it arrived missing a button and someone had sewn the collar to the coat so it was not in appropriate condition for sale at full price. I forgot to add my student discount to this order and was told that:- I could not have my discount added retrospectively- I could not receive a refund of the sale price difference (£18.00) despite originally ordering the item when it was on sale, because instead of ticking ""exchange"" on the form for the return of the size 14 coat, I simply sent it back as a return and ordered a 12 separately.I think that it would be reasonable on this occasion to refund the difference as I requested, since I effectively did exchange the coat, not refund it, and honour my student discount since there have been several issues with this purchase.I would like to be able to say that I received great service from Asos as this has always been the case in the past, but on this occasion I feel let down.Since the customer service reps on the online chat have been unable to help, I have sent a formal complaint.I would appreciate it if I could receive my discounts to resolve the issue once and for all.

When this date came and I contacted ASOS 3times for the whereabouts of my parcel, I received an email back just saying check back with the post office on 16Dec. 16Dec came and no parcel. I've now learnt after waiting all this time without any tracking info from ASOS that my parcel got lost(they cant even tell me where this happened) and they would send a new order only for the items I so badly wanted for someone for Christmas is now out of stock. I am very unhappy with this and will not recommend ASOS to anyone I speak to again!!

            I’ve been using ASOS for years now and did not have any issues until recently. I ordered two jackets and boots and decided i didn’t like any of them and returned them. I sent the jacket out first via royal mail, and the boots and second jacket via Hermes a couple days later. My royal mail package had arrived at their depot a while ago but there was no confirmation of a refund, and by this time I had already recieved my Hermes refund. I decided to contact customer services via twitter (Do not contact them on ANY online platform as they will reply with the same automated message that they are ‘looking into it’) they were no help at all, I did the same with the live chat and spoke to around 4 different people and no one could tell me whats going on. I then found a number for asos and called them up and they told me theyd refer my issue to the specialist team and I would just have to send a picture of the proof of my royal mail receipt. Thankfully I still kept it! I was sceptical though, but I have just recieved an email from their team to confirm my refund of the jacket. It was a tiresome and long experience and I’m disappointed in them but glad I’ve got my £160 back. Next time I’ll definitely pay with paypal!

            After reading all the comments and reviews about ASOS, I am so glad that I’m not the only one encountering these ridiculous problems LOL. can u expect it ? problems like DELAYED ORDER, RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DELAYED SHIPPING, DELAY DELAY DELAY from this “reputable” online shopping app/store ? ASOS should be responsible enough to account for their own mistake and learn to improve what they had not done right to be make themselves an even better company? BUT NO. I ordered my VANS SLIDE from this website, it states that I CAN RECEIVE IT ON 13NOVEMBER. NO DID NOT. then I contact the customer service to asked about my item status. They replied me that they will be making a replacement which will come on 21NOVEMBER, so I waited. GUESS WHAT ; back to checking the letterbox like a moron AGAIN for NOTHING. so I couldn’t tolerate anymore and requested to CANCEL MY ORDER AND REFUND MY FREAKING MONEY. they didn’t want to and referred me to their “ SPECIALIST TEAM” to clear their 💩 up. And so their specialist team agreed to refund. The worse thing is, I ordered this vans slide as a gift for my Boyfriend to surprise him yet thisss  happens. Honestly ASOS can u buck up and use ur time to correct all these delivery process and make sure to have a credible delivery company and keep to your promise by providing updates constantly instead of spending ur time to serve the customers for their problem ??? asos I don’t get u

            I have NEVER in my entire life written an online review but my experience with this company made me do it.  This company is terrible. I ordered two items Thanksgiving weekend. They were scheduled to arrive on December 3rd but didn't. When I contacted them they said they'd arrive on the 5th. Some problem with a delayed flight they said. It didn't arrive on the 5th. Now they said the 13th. Guess what? Didn't arrive. Now it was going to be the 15th. Nope! It finally came late afternoon on December 17th. On December 18th they sent me an email that they had mailed a replacement order as I had requested. 1. I never ordered a replacement order2. Couldn't they tell from tracking that it had now arrived?So, I wrapped the gifts and gave them out and very kindly I emailed them to let them know the original package had arrived. They responded that my new package would arrive December 21st and I was to return the original package.1. Raise your hand if you believe them that the package will arrive on December 212.  I don't have the originals in my possession. Do I ask for them back?I must package it up, go to a library to print out the label, and package it back up. WAIT!! When does your stupidity become my problem??

            My go to online store. Has everything I need in one place, with a great range of ‘tall’ products. I have never had a negative experience and have used ASOS since 2002. I feel that as long as you read their descriptions of clothing (material, sizing, etc) you will get what you have paid for. I also like the £9.99 a year next day delivery option. Still the first online store I visit.

            Ordered a pair of VANS trainers for christmas, even paid 12 euros for next day delivery, what do i get in the post instead...? A bloody school dress coat!? How on earth do you order trainers online and receive a coat from an ''established'' company i do not know.So now i have to print out some sort of return paper fill it in and return it to the UK. God knows how long that will take to get there and you wont get your money back until it does!!Oh and goodluck trying to contact customer support, its an absolute joke. No phone number to be found and no instant chat support.Only options i found was a twitter and facebook page...Which im still waiting two hours for them to reply on...WONT BE SHOPPING WITH THESE AGAIN.

            I've ordered a Christmas present on Sunday (16th December), I even paid 20€ for Next-Working Day delivery and I haven't received it yet! I have to mention that the order was supposed to arrive to Romania on 18th December. And now they are telling me that it hasn't even been shipped from their warehouse and to wait 8 working days until they can do something!!! They don't want to cancel the order or to ship it. They do nothing except passing from one to another from their team.  I was left without 170€ and without Christmas present! It's disappointing!

            It should not take 22 days to receive an order. I have 3 different ones I have been waiting on from this company. They claim to be having delays yet I have received all my other packages from different companies, one also being located in the UK.

            I ordered a pair of boots from Asos and they sent me the wrong size so I contact them to resolve issue hoping they will fix it. I received a new packaged and was sent wrong size again then it turns out they were out of stock now. I chatted online with customer service and they were so disrespectful and snobby . They try to make me feel like im stupid and I order wrong size but once I sent screen shots of my order they felt salty and close chat and left me hanging. I been Facebook chatting with them and so far I spoken to Lee, Dean, Torchi, Will, Salmon and Natasha. I sent both shoes back to them with the return label that they sent me and its been three weeks already and no one at Asos knows anything... Where the F*** is my $150 dollars!!!! I'm beyond upset !

            These guys are rubbish! Like, yeah, they have loads of stuff in stock and you can buy pretty much anything from them. However, actually receiving your items once purchased is waaaay too difficult. They use terrible couriers and almost never deliver things on time. And even if you pay for next day delivery, they'll use DHL who will try and deliver something at around 7pm, which is rubbish for a next day delivery if you're having it delivered to an office of place of work. Oh, and you might get the wrong order and have to go through the painstaking process of returning an item. Yay! Good luck with that. Honestly, just find your items on a different website and save yourself the hassle.

            Made an order after ten days it didn't arrive. Contacted them and they said my bank declined payment. Seems unlikely as used card multiple times that day and after. Had no email about this (they claim one was sent but none in my inbox or junk box). I then reordered and they sent size 42 jeans and not 32. I have now contacted customer services 3 times and they keep promising me its being looked into while I have no Christmas present for my cousin. They wont give me a phone number to call either.

            Absolutely terrible company. Placed my order and paid for next day delivery. Order didn't turn up for 3 days. Contact ASOS via online chat and was told to contact DHL myself, I thought the delivery company worked for but anyway. Spent 30 mins on the phone sorting out my own delivery. Then contacted ASOS to ask for a refund on delivery as 6.95 for something that didn't happen is appaulling.  No response apart from an automated email again. Got online again only to be told it needs to go to specialist team for review, well it's clearly obvious you didn't deliver so what's the deal! Told it will take 5 days and I will be contacted, 7 days later still no response. Then emailed again to be told it will take another 8 days, really. One of the dresses was broken when I finally got the order. Still no refund, STAY AWAY, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!

            Worst customer service ever- I will not do repeat business with this company again- they are very rude and don’t give a flying flip about customers at all- STAY AWAY- The Iconic is by far a better online  store platform and at least they have a number you can call and speak with them direct- ASOS are pretty much uncontactable and shady- they deter customers from sending back returns regardless if you find items ill fitting or too small- ASOS make the whole process unbearable- and ASOS supply duplicate return notes which the post office does not accept so you end up forking out to send back return items which they supposedly are meant to provide free return shipping for - Really bad customer service guys and the ASOS representatives are just dizzy, there is zero accountability -  they have no account notes so they can’t follow through on disputes etc returns etc- You end up repeating the same case to ten different reps over and over. Oh and you can only contact them online which basically means they hardly ever get back in contact within an acceptable timeframe - it’s all in their own time, they don’t give a damn about you- they don’t give a damn whether it xmas

            Very disappointed to date! I ordered late November and the money was deducted from my account on 29 November. I was given a tracking number, but the number is unknown when I attempt to track it. I sent an email to the company last week and had no response. I sent another email today and received an email from hahahahaha (very weird return email address) advising that they are busy and that my delivery is on the way (email was very poor English so I hope I read this correctly). I am feeling a little concerned that this Company may not be legit. Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experience/response??

            I've been a customer with ASOS for more than a five years till now. I purchase three orders back in November 2018 and sent them back in somewhere around on November 20th. My mistake, the post office that I go, I usually dropped my packages off and leave. I never as for the receipt since I never have a problem before. It is already a month past by, and I never receive my refund back which is in total over $600. Contacted ASOS, they were not helpful at all. They all asked me for the proof of postage which I don't have it. Therefore, they are not planning to return my money. That is a lot of money for me, and I want to share with all my experience.

            So far all my orders have reached my house. The shipping used to be worst part. I had to wait for months but the new tracking system is far more helpful than the previous one. They reach my house faster now although from months to weeks but my orders are international, so I give it a pass. However, Tell your delivery guys to call before or when they reach my house not after. I don't have super-hearing and my time is not that flexible. They have delayed my order twice now.

            Awful, awful, awful customer service. Ordered an item this month and have premier delivery. However it did not arrive next day, or the day after or the day after that and so on. So I contacted customer services to see where the parcel was as there was no info forthcoming from the delivery company. I was cut off first time I tried to find out what was happening. I tried again and was given the same rhetoric over and over, wait another 5 days and see what happens. That’s it. No apology, I can’t cancel, I can’t get my money back, they won’t contact the delivery company to see where my parcel is or why the item I have paid for has not gotten to me. Actually, I found them quite impolite and impossible. I asked to speak to a manager and was blocked. The message I’m getting is that they don’t give a damn whether they provide a decent service, whether I get my items, or whether they have taken my money without supplying the goods. This has put me right off of ever using them again. Shocking and very disappointing really for such a big company.

            The previous reviewer (Liz) summed it up. I could simply cut and paste her complaint as mine her rhetoric more or less mirrors mine. I sincerely hope that our honest reviews steer potential customers away from ASOS and exposes how shabbily they treat their customers. I have never encountered a company with such a pathetic ambivalence towards it's customers. Trustpilot tells the world that 58% of 5622 people who have sent a review in are unhappy with your service. That means you have lost more than 3000 customers because of your failed processes and arrogance. Sort yourselves out.

            I ordered an item from asos on the 1st of December and I have premier delivery which means I have paid for a years worth of next day delivery. The next day the item didnt arrive. I waited two futher days nothing came. I then spoke to asos on their chatline where I was told i had to wait a further 5 days. I spoke to them again on that day and was yet again told to wait a few more days. By now the item i ordered which was for some interviews isnt really needed. I have just spoke to them again and they said they will now pass it onto a specialist team but id have to wait a further 48hours to know anything. I was fed up of waiting around and chasing them about the order so I asked to have a full refund and said to forget sending it now. I was them told id be updated abot a possible refund after the specialist team had looked into it. So no refund no nearer to finding out where it was than a week ago. I asked to make a formal complaint and was refused. I have been a customer with asos for many years and use them fairly regulary but clearly they do not value their customers I am extremely annoyed by the customer service I have recieved I understand its a busy time of year and would have been fine if they had emailed me to say theres been a delay or it wasnt possible to deliver next day at the moment instead they made me chase it up repeatedly and brushed off any complaint i tried to make

I started to contact customer service using messenger and spoke with 3 different agents. All of them were talking about some duties payments that were pending to pay so that my order could be released from customs. Apparently, you will be able to create your order on ASOS and paid the amount that you agreed and on top of that, after your order is confirmed and when you cannot cancel anymore, they will send you a second email informing you about some customs duties to pay. In my case, I never received the supposed email and that's why the order show still processing. I wonder what happens if Clients don't pay these HIDDEN DUTIES. Will ASOS receive back the package and keep the Clients money? - I totally believe this is the case, as they already said that the order cannot be canceled.To all my friends, please avoid using ASOS so that you don't be fooled or cheated. They will make you pay a specific amount, later on, ask you for more money to release the package and if by any chance you never receive that notification, that means that you will never receive nor your package nor your money back.

            Horrible. Package came 10 days late. Event is long over with. During the delay ASOS refused a refund or any compensation for an almost two week delay past the delivery date THEY represented. Rude and nasty customer service reps. Say things like “it’s not our fault” asked for manager and was told that managers don’t speak to customers. What? Pushed the issue, they said one would call me in 24-48 hours. Absolutely did not receive a call. This place is a total scam. Steer clear. Don’t do it to yourself.

            Ordered 20+ times, never had an issue.... BUT their express shipping service is beyond terrible. I remember a year or so ago ordinary shipments (non-express) would sometimes come in 5 days from the UK > Australia which was amazing. However, the 3 times I've used the express service (and foregone other discounts to use the AUEXPRESS code) it has taken over a week to come. When I ordered this time it said 'Delivery by Friday'... well it's Friday and it hasn't even landed in Australia yet. Super annoying and a waste of money I could have saved.

            Ordered a jacket on Nov 26. ASOS informed me it would be late so they refunded my shipping fee. Was supposed to be deliver Dec 6 - it is now December 13 & still have not receive the jacket. When I reach out via email with support they just keep pushing the receiving date back. First it was if you don't receive by Dec 12 please reach to us. Now since I have not received it, I'm being told there is an issue with the delivery service and if I don't receive it by December 17th to email them again.

            I am really disappointed with ASOS customer service, Ordered a package 3 weeks ago and still haven’t received it. Asos have done very little to reassure me. Their customer service reps on the chat provide generic responses, I’ve been trying to solve my problem for 2 weeks now just because they keep postponing giving me a real answer. My order contained outfits for Christmas an New Year eve and gifts, and now I won’t receive them anymore because 6 out of 10 items are somehow out of stock. I am disappointed and will never use Asos again.

            I have been ordering off ASOS for years and have never had a problem prior to now. I have waited two weeks for my order, have contacted them several times through their live chat - only to be told that my issue will be forwarded to a 'specialist team'. I have just received a refund  which I didn't ask for - I wanted the goods I ordered - without any explanation as to why my parcel hasn't arrive and without the choice of a refund. I am disgusted by this service. The goods I ordered were presents. The least I could receive is an explanation and an apology.

Suffice to say my order went missing when Hermes was processing it.

Will continue to shop with Asos highly recommend.

            I've been a loyal customer of Asos for years. They've probably made a fortune off me but this time I've been so disappointed in their customer service. Ordered a package on 25th November - it is now 13th December and it's still not here. While the issue lies with the courier, Collect+ (and I have contacted them separately), Asos have done very little to reassure me. Their customer service reps on social media provide generic responses and say they have contacted Collect+ and haven't received a response.  I have contacted them myself and have received numerous responses leading me to believe they haven't made much of an effort at their end. My order contained outfits for Christmas parties and also gifts which have now sold out online. I am so disappointed and won't be using Asos again.Also, their loyalty programme was fab but has since been scrapped which is disappointing. There is no incentive for being a loyal customer.

            I would have given them a negative 5 star if I had the choice. I created this account simply because I felt I need to write down my extremely frustrating experience with ASOS so less people will have to go through this. They are so outdated and slow in terms of processing any return. Don't ever expect they update you on time when you ship your return stuff back. The worst of the worst, ASOS absolutely doesn't give a sh** about their customer even though plus the quality of the stuff they sale is extremely bad and looks nothing like the picture (At least try impress your customer at one thing). Usually companies have a number to call or an effective online chat system. But guess what ASOS has? No direct number and an online chat system where on one talks to you. I'm shocked that their customer representatives would just completely ignore me on online chat and kept me waiting for 30min. After I gone really upset about their attitude, they sent me an email telling me it was a ""technical issue"". (Oh really? you couldn't send me this email right away). Not only they don't care, but also they LIE and makes up false excuse to make you go away! The customer service at ASOS is joke, compared to any online fashion website you could name. I will NEVER EVER shop at this website again. No business will succeed this way. We will see.

            I ordered a watch for my son's christmas present via ASOS last week on line.  I thought i had  ordered clothes from them previously without incident but have now realised I was a first time customer. The parcel was delivered by Royal mail. The external packaging was intact although ridiculously large for the size of the item which was a wrist watch. I was surprised to find the dress box for the watch out of its plastic packaging and flopping about in the large box. When I opened this I foung a geniune Armani booklet and watch mount but no watch. ASOS do no provide a direct telephone customer support service. I have emailed them with no response. I have facebook messaged them with a response that they have acknowledged contact and will be in touch but no time scale. I have retained all packaging and my fear is they will counter that we are laying a false claim of theft in transit. The bottom line is that I will have go to a shop and buy my son his gift ahead of the big day and be out of pocket twice.Today I received the following response from ASOSello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a replacement of your item:- Armani Exchange AX2099 Chronograph Gold Stainless Steel Strap WatchIt’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations.

            While they have 24 hour chat, it doesn't seem to be something they should pay for given the customer experience team is clearly just there to tell you tough cookies on any of your problems. Their solution is to have you reach back out at specified times just to get the same answer... there is nothing we can do we are sorry. It is the most frustrating merry-go-round you will ever get on. The tracking doesn't update and when you do get your package (1-2 weeks late) half of it is good quality and half of it looks like a child picked the material. I can deal with the hit or miss clothes, but the customer service making the already frustrated customer do all the work, and constantly saying reach back in a day or two, only to yet again tell me there is really nothing they can do and they are sorry if I am upset, seems unacceptable to me. Answering the question with a straightforward answer, and not a false promise that someone will fix it in the future would be more satisfying. Just know what you are getting into, and don't expect your items to be there for any specific occasion.

            I recommend against doing business with asos. On the surface, the asos web site seems comparable to Urban Outfitters or Zara, but the similarities end there when you click to submit your order. At that point, your order falls into the black hole of their order fulfillment and customer care (more like customer chaos). None of the dates will match reality. Your order is “despatched”, which means, thrown in a pile to wait until you complain. The date promised for “delivery” is the date they start manufacturing the items in your order. The “tracking” will indicate “processing” for many days while the items are made. At no point will the tracking actually get updated or show where exactly your package is located. During this process, you contact their customer chaos group, thinking something must be wrong. Scarily, you discover that this is business as usual and the kind of unprofessional chaos that constitutes their company. Each person will lie to you about where the package is and when it is coming. You will hear many different dates from many different people.If you compare this buffoonery and chaos to dealing with Urban Outfitters, where you can actually talk to real customer care people by phone without waiting on hold, people who can nicely tell you exactly where your order is and the exact day you will receive it, it’s very sad. Compare it to Amazon, and it’s a joke. I’ve waited 2.5 weeks for “in stock” items that Amazon would have delivered in 48 hours. Still have no idea if I will ever receive my order.If you look on LinkedIn, there are 100+ people listed as the CEO of asos in a range of countries around the world...Australia, Turkey, even someone in West Virginia. If you look on the asos jobs website, it says 30% of their workforce is in the customer chaos group. How come none of them seem to know when a package is scheduled for delivery? How many thousands of people does it take to screw in a light bulb? I’ve conversed with a dozen different people in customer chaos about my package. They all give a different date for delivery. Many of the dates have long past. Some offered me a discount on my next order...why would I throw more money into the black hole when I never received my first order?

I reached out to customer service to see if anyone can help me out and they told me the only way to take advantage of the sale price is to return the other items and place a new order. To me this sounds like a waste of money, time and resources for both parties when we can achieve the same results if ASOS did like a two-day price guarantee. This is something I hope ASOS looks into and considers doing or else they'll lose a returning customer.

            My order was due to arrive yesterday. I was busy changing my baby when the doorbell rang and hoped they would leave a card or put it in my safe place. Not so. No card was left, but Hermes sent an email saying delivery was successfully delivered to me (my name) with a signature included (not mine). I’ve checked safe spots and nothing. Tried contacting ASOS but their chat wasn’t working well and I was left waiting then disconnected. Their email form also wouldn’t send. I finally reached someone on chat after 3 long attempts to be told I would hear from them in 5 days but if not to contact again. What? I was counting on my order for an event this week and feel jilted. Nothing was done to reassure or correct the situation, which includes fraudulent practices (forging my signature).

            Worst customer service i have ever experienced. My return didn't move for weeks and they kept wanting me to wait ten days to START a case for my lost return.

            OH.  MY.  GOD.!!!  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!  BEWARE!!! Do not buy anything from this rip-off company!!!  I ordered 8 items from ASOS for my daughter for Christmas gifts.  I placed my order on October 29, 2018, and I specifically asked about their extended return policy for Christmas gifts.  They told me there would definitely be an extended return policy, but that it had not been posted on their website yet.  So, of course, I thought there would be no problem if we needed to return something that didn't fit.  HOWEVER, as it turns out, in order to return something under their Christmas return policy, your order had to be placed on or after November 1, 2018.  I placed my order three days before that date.  But I had no way of knowing that I was placing my order too early!  They should have told me that, especially since I told them the situation and asked about it.  They will not make any exceptions at all!  So, I can tell that at least one item is going to be too big, but I'm stuck with it!  Of course, they said I could send it back and then the warehouse would decide if I would get a refund.  Now why would I do that?  I am not sending anything back unless I'm guaranteed a refund!  That's just crazy!  And my customer service rep, Tania, was like talking to a robot!  We did this over chat.  She just kept saying the same thing over and over again and was not helpful at all!  Basically, all she kept saying was that there was nothing she could do because that's their policy.  She did not answer any questions that I asked either!  Just horrible!  I told her if she did not resolve this issue to my satisfaction that I would NEVER buy anything from ASOS EVER AGAIN and that I would post terrible, negative reviews about ASOS.  She did not seem to care at all.  I also asked to speak to a manager or someone above her.  She said everyone is trained the same way and will tell me the same exact thing.  I told her that a good, decent company that wants to keep its customers would make an exception under the circumstances.  No response.  So then I looked at the reviews, and it was no surprise that ASOS has horrible reviews!  Wish I had looked at them before!  Clearly, ASOS does not care at all about their customers!I'm just furious!!!!!!  STAY FAR AWAY FROM ASOS!!!!!

            What a totally garbage company.  I placed an order on the 22nd of November, which was dispatched shortly after.  On the day it's supposed to be delivered I get a notification that there's a 72 hour delay.  I contact CS and they can't even be bothered to look into my order.  They tell me there's nothing they can look into for 72 hours and to contact them when the time frame is up.  I wait the three days and again, no package.  I contact CS and again they tell me there's another 72 hour delay, and they cannot tell me anything more about my order until those 72 hours are up.  I wait and no package arrives.  I contact CS a third time and, shocker, there's another 72 hour delay.  That brings us to today and I still have no package.  CS refuses to speak to me beyond the ""contact us in 72 hours"" nonsense, and also refuses to cancel my package.  What a truly horrible experience talking to these people.  CS acts like the customer is the one inconveniencing the company and that we have no right to be frustrated about a missing order that has been paid for.  I would stay as far away from this company as possible.  They are frauds.  Do not expect help.  Do not expect to be compensated for any mishaps on their end.

            I usually never write reviews about anything but I just felt that I had to notify others about this issue. As a lot of people are shopping with asos more and more now. I ordered two items recently and they were meant to be a Christmas gift for someone. Once I received my order I saw that one of the items was not the item I originally ordered. It was completely different to what I had ordered, only similarities being the size and colour. I rang up the customer service and they assured me that they would arrange for me to receive the correct item. I also made sure to contact them by email so that they have proof in writing. In the email I clearly stated the item that was send to me and I clarified that this is not what I originally ordered. Two days passed and I received an email stating that my order is on its way, however once again it was the wrong item. At this point I was very frustrated and tired of calling their customer service. After speaking to them on the phone they realised the mistake and told me that the correct item will be send. I have my doubts... I do not understand how they can mess up my order to this extend when I made it very clear which item was send correctly and which one was not. Now it's been a week and I still have not received my item. At this time of the year making such mistakes is very frustrating for us customers because everyone knows the stress of getting presents sorted. This is very degrading for such an extremely well known company.

            Unfortunately I ordered all of this years xmas gifts from this place. I guess I should blame my self as I did read reviews beforehand. I ordered for a 1000 euros. They took the money and sent me confirmation. Then they cancelled my order and asked me for a copy of my passport and bank statement. I sent this after 2 minutes. Now they are not responding. Closing down the chats. They still have my 1000 euros, but order is cancelled, and they will keep the money for 2 weeks before giving it back, meaning I have to buy new xmas gifts AFTER XMAS.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ASOS.

            The customer service for Asos is diabolical! They offer such services as same day delivery to take your money then let you down. I needed an outfit for a Thursday, I bought the outfit Wednesday morning at 7am paid for same day delivery and with no warning was told at 10pm Wednesday night the outfit was going to arrive a day late rendering this purchase useless. When I asked for a refund I was told to return the product and wait up to 2 weeks for a refund.Not a hint of compensation for Asos being incompetent and incapable of fulfilling there guarantee.

            Very bad customer service. Ordered a suit on 30th Nov. Got a despatch email on the 8th December. This morning (10th December) got another email saying received the parcel back and refunded. I have mentioned this to the CS and they said it is out of control. Delivery was attempted on the 5th, which is a complete lie since my address was a business address there were people here. CS solution was to ""reorder the items if you want"". That's it completely their fault but not even offered next day delivery for their mistake. Last time I will be shopping with these clowns.

            Terrible service. I ordered something for next day delivery. Over a week later this still hadn't been delivered. The tracking information said that a delivery had been attempted once in over 7 days but no slip was through the door and I had already told the courier to leave this in a safe place in my garden, which was ignored. I doubt delivery was even attempted at all. Further, the item needed no signature and was small enough to fit through my letterbox. I contacted ASOS 3 times to request that this be sorted as I needed the item urgently and the information on the courier website said to contact the retailer. Every time I got an automated response saying to wait until a few more days had passed and see if it would be delivered. This meant that despite ordering something over a week in advance and paying for next day delivery the item was not received in time. I still haven't had the item. Totally unacceptable and I will not be using ASOS again.

            Worst customer service ever! I paid £7 for next evening delivery. I received an email at 21:18 to inform me that a delivery had been attempted (I was home all evening) yet no card had been left. I contacted them on the online chat and was informed that despite the email the parcel was definitely going to be delivered. After 10pm I contacted them again and was informed that it would be delivered the next day and that the attempted delivery could have meant that the Van was broken rather then it being attempted at my address so I requested a refund for the delivery and was rejected! The guy says ‘regardless of wheather you care what the email said the delivery was attempted’ howeve 10 minutes before this he had informed me that the email could have just meant that the van had broken!! Very very poor customer service. He also told me there was no one higher then him to complain to. Well thanks a lot Mathew!!

            Asos is the worst online company, never in a million years through ordering items to arrive in a week they still have not shipped out, I have been waiting for my order 2 weeks now past the original date, first it was a ""delay"" which I understand but once the issue was in asos hands my package time still did not improve. Not to mention coustmer service has no number because they are very aware how many people have this frequent issue and hate there services and how they operate with communicating with coustmers. To close this off I have waiting 3 weeks after they said I would get my package if I was someone dumb I would've forgotten by now!

            It's a great hub for different brands, but it is what it is, cheap fashion, fast, and cheap, like really cheap. And this affects what you get, it's kinda like playing Russian roulette, sometimes it's good and most of the times not so much... Lately it's getting worse (and we are talking about the cheaper brands, like the own ASOS brand), there's always something that's off, you find your dream garment ´, but it's cut weird, or the fabric is awful, or the pattern..or... ASOS just can't seem to get it right. Many of these clothes is very similar to to cheap ones at wish, and I often wonder ''who wears this??'', and ''who CAN wear this?'' it's often very poorly sewn, and not washable, like I said, there's just always something that's off, it's the common saying of ''You get what you pay for''. All this said, it's great hub for different brands, and kudos the stylist on ASOS, they always make the clothes on the models look like a million dollars!

            Absolutely atrocious customer care from ASOS this morning. Had an issue with my website shopping bag malfunctioning and disappearing. The RESERVED item in my bag then showed out of stock after my bag emptied by itself, meaning it was either still reserved by the (now non-existent) malfunctioned bag or the reservation system was not working. Thinking I could find out if the item had actually sold or was just erroneously showing as still reserved and save myself waiting the 50 minutes to test if the item would unreserve/make sure it wasn't lost forever, I got in touch with two of their reps. I was misunderstood, ignored, and met with absolute incompetence over and over again. I suggested that the item was showing as out of stock because it was still linked to the malfunctioning bag, and may reappear when the 60 minute reservation window ended. I asked the ASOS reps to see if they could check this, but they were not able as they do not have access to sales or reservation information - how can a site provide competent service without this info? I then asked simply if it was possible for an item showing out of stock to do so because it's still reserved by me as my bag was still stored on the system somewhere, the customer reps failed to understand this theory, didn't have an answer for something surely so simple about the website's workings, refused to contact anyone else in their department for information or escalate to a manager, and fed me copy and paste responses/just plain fallacious information about the issue. The first rep ended the conversation abruptly before a solution was found. She also stated emphatically that there was no issue on their end and later suggested clearing my cookies despite the product showing as out of stock for her too, showing that she does not understand what cookies do. Both reps stated repeatedly 'as the item is out of stock there is nothing we can do', despite the fact that I had reserved it in my own bag! At no point did I feel heard or respected as a longstanding ASOS customer, I felt like I was dealing with uninformed, overwhelmed employees with absolutely zero ability to comprehend or assist in my issue. I was told I had lost the item due to an error and there's nothing else that could be done. I ended up waiting the 50 minutes, and it turned out that I was right to begin with: the item was held in reservation by my original bag and had become available again! How could ASOS not tell me this incredibly simple information? Had I listened to the customer service reps, I would've not bothered to wait and lost the item forever. How can you trust a website and shop with peace of mind if the reservation system doesn't work properly, and how can the employees not know the way this website feature works?During this whole process, I complained about not being understood, and the ASOS reps continued to not be able to grasp the issue or escalate to anyone with sufficient understanding, it felt like they weren't properly reading my query or giving me any attentive care. I also asked for the complaints contact and was ignored twice.I could purchase the item from ASOS, but I will be purchasing direct from the retailer instead. The bad service has dissuaded me from using ASOS in the future. Do not buy here if you want a company that respects and values you. They do not invest in customer service sufficiently, evidently, and if you have any issues you will not be treated well.

            I placed an order on Monday, it came yesterday but one item was missing. I got into a chat with Bethany to find out where the other item was, she asked what the item was and told me I wasn’t the account holder and ended the chat. I tried again to chat to another person who told me the item wasn’t in stock when I ordered it, so why let me order it, but they charged me for it and shows on my account order details. I asked why didn’t they inform me of the cancellation, he said we did email you check your junk mail, I told him you didn’t and asked for a copy of the email, he said I can’t because it’s automated. He did not believe me that I hadn’t received an email and said I can’t help you anymore and ended the chat, I’ve facebook messaged them as well, they’ve read it but not replied.

            Dear Asos, I have recently spoken to one of your colleagues via phone who explained that your courier is unable to locate the postcode provided from my side hence they failed to deliver my parcel for the 3rd time in a row! Now first of all let me elaborate how extremely frustrating it is, that unless I call in to explain my situation I am most likely not to see this product like ever in my life, as of no one being able to explain the reason my parcel is still not with me! Now after being explained from your side the challenges you have - despite the fact that I have received another parcel yesterday assigned to the same exact address that I have provided to you - I have come up with an alternative solution which was to provide another address very close to the original one. Now your kind but less intelligent colleague has advised that this is not possible since the postcode has to match the existing address. Regardless of me trying to explain over and over again this to your kind yet again not so intelligent colleague that the address is assigned to the following postcode, he’s told me that he can not provide an alternative address to your courier, YET on their website they strictly point out that only the retailer can change the original destination of this. Now here I am again with no parcel - the suit I have ordered for my Christmas party which happened last night - with no money and with a lot of my precious time wasted. On top of that all you did was, not overcoming the challenge but given me the same solution which most likely is going to fail again based on the conversation with your colleague, as of your system not being able to allocate the postcode provided from your side! Here I am again waiting another day for you to come up with a better plan which we could’ve been solved immediately but your reaction time and responsiveness makes me want to cry! Yours Sincerely Attila

            ASOS is terrible they use the courier Hermes because they are cheap and it saves them money. However Hermes is garbage and ASOS customer service have no way of talking to Hermes. So when my parcel was delivered to the wrong address it leaves me the customer having to do all the work to sort it out. Even after I contacted Hermes they still delivered to the same wrong address. And ASOS are just like sorry pal nothing we can do about it.They chose to deliver through this carrier even though it causes us the consumers nothing but stress and wasted time even when we spend our money with them. This to me shows they have nothing but contempt for their own customers. I will not use them again in future and I recommend you don't either.

And the delivery company never came to pick it up, I contacted all personnel I could, both from the delivery company and ASOS, yet they were simply ignoring me or copying and pasting rules, and not helping at all.

            I’ve only made three orders with ASOS yet. The first one went alright. Gotta warn you tho, everything you see online with patterns will not look the same (I got a bikini with a flower pattern and it was so much bigger than the one showed on the photo, what a disappointment). I returned two items and calmly waited for my refund. No problem there. The second order didn’t. Something to do with my address being wrong (it wasn’t). I contacted the customer service and they were pretty helpful even tho they didn’t provide a reason for the address issue. They gave me a code with -20% off since my order had been on black friday and I didn’t want to reorder if I had to pay extra. Then I made my third order (basically everythig I ordered on the second one) and this time everything worked out great. I’m still waiting for my refund from the second order but I’m pretty confident everything will work out fine.I have to say, I’m happy with ASOS. So far at least.

            I have been a customer of ASOS for years and have never had an issue regarding items or receiving orders like many people have. However I have asos vouchers to use but the website won't let me use them for some reason. Been on live chats and contacting via email for months but when I email they just say they will get back to me in 48hours and that never happens. On live chats I have found that they abruptly stop the chat halfway through. I really don't know how they get away with running a company like this, it makes me so angry and I think trading standards should get involved

            Terrible customer service.I ordered an item and received the incorrect item. I sent it back and ordered it again. Second delivery I received the wrong item again. I raised this with ASOS customer complaints. They were extremely unhelpful. I pointed out that I had 2 wasted journeys to collect the wrong items. Their response was, you could wait at home to have items collected. This was their magical solution. Who has time to wait at home! Very badly trained staff, clearly the staff on the warehouse are not trained to read orders correctly. I will not be returning to ASOS.

            I agree with some reviews here which say that merchandise hardly looks like how they are portrayed in asos website. Delivery is just as bad as well. The most appalling thing though is their absolute disregard for customer service. I received a note with my package with scribbling that said, 'f*** you, b****'. I contacted them with photos and they haven't even reached out to me after a week. All I wanted was an apology and reason to why this happened but it clearly is too much to ask for.

            Terrible customer service. All the express deliveries are late. I ordered from them three times, and it never comes on time. This time I ordered 2 parcels on the same day, somehow one managed to reach the delivery courier, the other could not even clear customs. I was told there was a delay with the carrier and I had to wait a whole week after my estimated delivery date - never even told me what sort of delay it was and subtly but repeatedly hinted me to close the chat when I probed about it. How ridiculous, making a big purchase to get express 2-day delivery and being told you need to wait 10 days for it. Even slower than standard delivery? God knows how long I have to wait if I had picked standard delivery. Probably the last time I'll ever order from them.

Was then told to wait until the 6th by extremely unhelpful customer service who just kept sending me a tracking link. Contacted hermes,they said they lost it after it was dispatched from asos warehouse. I told asos this and have been told i have to wait until the 12th December before they can do anything. I know the parcel wont come but they said they cant contact hermes until the parcel is 7 days late. Then they start the process which takes 7 days,then i have to wait for a refund. Absolute joke. No apologies no offer of refund no offer of discount on my next order. Absolutely nothing and so unhelpful. Why use a delivery company who you’re not able to contact?

They have refunded the amount for the other two items and when i asked them why they haven't informed me before making any action they told me that they sent me an email (they lie as i checked junk folder and there was nothing there...). I have asked them when the other two items will be despatched and they told me that they sent my money back so i will not get the other two items of my order because there are not in stock and they do not know when they will be in stock.Such an unprofessional behavior, i lost the Black Friday period as i would have ordered from other online shop!Stay away from this site!

            For a company of this scale and with this image, it’s absolutely shocking how poor their customer service is. The customer service responses don’t deal with everything you’ve raised, are usually standard and not personalised and they just seem incapable of actually resolving anything. It is he most frustrating customer experience I’ve had to the point where I’m considering not using ASOS anymore. It’s my main source of online shopping at the moment so it’s a big deal to stop using them. But that’s how bad things have got now. If you don’t have any issues then ordering and delivery is great but as soon as something goes wrong there’s no hope. Absolutely atrocious, unacceptable, terrible awful customer service. I even tweeted out of pure desperation but that was completely ignored. I think we need another ASOS style online shop but with good customer service to rival ASOS...

            Been a customer with ASOS for years now. Between the family we have spent thousands. Premier next day delivery renewed every year and we're the highest level on the reward system they use. DPD always get parcels out next day delivery with an excellent communication tracking system, but all of a sudden Hermes are being used more and more, DHL also. They both seem to be bad, Hermes is ridiculous and they need to get rid. I expect DPD is too expensive now. They've got rid of the A-List reward system thing and deliveries arent coming at all. Must have a ""do not deliver"" mark on our address. The last three orders we've made have not arrived. Two with Hermes and one with DHL. Not impressed. ASOS you've lost a family of loyal customers I used to trust the next day delivery now we all joke ""if Hermes comes up on the tracking you're screwed""!!!

            I would give 0 stars if it was possible. My last experience with them have been beyond awful.I placed an order for next day delivery on the 12/11. I was informed my parcel was delivered to the Collect + store on the 13/11. On the 14/11 I went to collect the order and was informed by the store that ASOS had requested a return of the parcel and it was collected that afternoon to be returned? I never requested a return and so contacted ASOS who had no idea why. I requested the resend me out the items next day as I needed them ASAP and they ""helpfully"" informed me the only way to sort this would be to order the items (and pay for them of course) again. The order was over £120 which makes it an atrocious procedure. I was informed I would receive a full refund once my ""return"" was processed. Fast forward 3 weeks after my holiday and I notice I still havent received any refund or update from ASOS. When I click to view my order status it simply shows as ""shipped"" so I get in touch with ASOS who advise they still dont know where my parcel is? I checked the delivery tracking info and it says it was returned to ASOS on 19/11 (6 days after it already wasnt at the collection location) and there is no update since. This means that its been 22 days since I placed the order and I still dont have any order or my money back.Pathetic and their overall reviews here prove it.

            I order a lot from ASOS and have been a customer for abt 8years. The clothes are good value for money but ohmygod the hoops you have to jump through to get them delivered! Customer care is negative - you get often no response to emails or DMs but when you do, you get no information just canned responses.I had a package go missing in 2017 and finally got my money back through PayPal because ASOS was giving me the run around for nearly 3 months.Every order takes a minimum of 6 days to despatch and seems to only do so after I've emailed them 3 times. My last order placed 26 November has still not been despatched and my messages are going unanswered or met with canned responses.They keep taking orders they can't seem to fulfill in a decent amount of time.Sadly I have no choice but to order from them because the brands they carry don't generally ship to my country but after at least 3 years of consistently horrible service and no customer care to speak of, I might have to re-evaluate my options.

            Awful customer service. Ordered multiple pairs of jeans in different sizes to try on during Black Friday event. They were left by DPD in a communal hallway without my authorisation or signature. DPD sent the driver back to tell me where he left them, which was pointless. Then the driver came again the next day to try and get me to sign a piece of paper to say I received the delivery. I refused as I hadn’t. He told if I don’t he will get charged for the missing parcel, so obviously expected me to fork out over £300 for his error. I’ve contacted ASOS they have confirmed the driver did not follow procedure (he forged a signature, didn’t take a picture of where he so say left the parcel). But will not refund or replace the items, which is so shocking. They are an awful company and as someone else said verging on a scam website. I’ve been told I have to contact my bank to try and get money back. Absolutely devastating to be down over £300 before Christmas. Please do not use this company, the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

            Honestly the worse customer service and about all you can expect from an online retailer. I would not mind half as much but the issue is I ordered an item for next day delivery waited at the required time window and was informed a delivery was attempted whilst I was in my flat and of course I apparently did no answer the door. NO ONE KNOCKED AND IF THEY DID THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT A DELIVERY SLIP WHICH OF COURSE THERE WAS NO SIGN OF. Same thing happens following day, I take 3 hours our of my valuable day to be in the house and same thing happens again then to find out they do the same the following day and then my item get's sent back to ASOS. Unless you like wasting your time waiting for packages that don't arrive and like being accused of not being in to answer the door when you were oh and appreciate very low standard customer service AVOID ASOS AT ALL COSTS.

            I ordered an item on Thursday 29th Nov for next day delivery to my workplace, I was informed on Friday it would be delayed until Sat 1st December. Great, when the office is shut! None the less I make the exception and go to the office for the delivery. It doesn't turn up (DHL are the courier). I ring DHL who say the driver could not access the building (odd since the door was open and the intercom accessible). Despite being told it'd be delivered later that day, it still never arrived. I contacted ASOS via messenger *after they'd ignored earlier emails for 24hours. ASOS claim they have no ability to influence the delivery companies who they have allowed (allegedly) to decide to return the parcel to them. What's more annoying is the DHL driver turning up in my office on Monday 3rd claiming to be there to collect a parcel. Now I'm thinking the parcel has been stolen or gone missing and ASOS say they will process a refund when they get the parcel back. This is unacceptable, ASOS are responsible for delivering goods (by law)  and by a specified date. Yet they shirk this and blame others, and have no interest in resolving issues, sending the same lame responses to every query raised. I am starting to feel like they're a struggling company, I won't be ordering anymore.

I just contacted Asos customer service (Hermes does not have a number or email to contact them!) via chat, asking them to contact Hermes as I could not stay home another full day waiting for them, and I needed them to collect the parcel tonight or tomorrow before 11am at the latest. After waiting 10+ minutes for a rep to appear on the chat, I explained the issue, and he apologized for me not having received my order. I was complaining about a return!!!! He apologized again but proved his further inutility by saying that Asos offers other 5 ways of returning an item and I could try other ways. Are you kidding me? I explained twice my request and he didn't get it! How is that supposed to help me? This person shouldn't even have a job! As useless as someone can be!

            I’ve always been a loyal customer of Asos. Love the website and offerings. Always a bit disappointing that there are no descriptions, product measurements etc but I’ve gotten round that. I pay £10 a year for the next day membership, placed an order last Monday, due to be delivered Tuesday. Nothing came. Contacted on the Wednesday. Told to wait until the following Monday!!! Monday morning I contacted, told to come back after midnight. Came back after midnight, told it will go to the a “specialist team” who will be in touch in a further 24 hours......I just want my money back now! Staff on live chat rude and uncommittal. Won’t tell me whether or not I’ll even get my money back!! Keep pushing back the deadline of when it will be resolved. If I don’t have a response after these next set of 24 hours I will be forced to put in a dispute via PayPal.

            One star is FAR too good.Placed an order for £110 on a Thursday 29th November 2018, evening @ 11pm thinking I'd selected next day delivery, which I quickly realised the next morning I hadn't. So I got through to chat and asked if I could upgrade delivery. They said I couldn't and that I'd need to wait for delivery the following Friday (8th December 2018).At this point I decided I'd cancel my order as I needed the items that weekend, and unfortunately it was pointless me waiting for another 8 days for items I'd no longer want/need.I went and purchased some of the items elsewhere and got next day delivery no issue, great I thought. I'll just cancel my order now with ASOS as it's not needed. So less than 12 hours after placing my order, I get told no ""you cannot cancel, you have 1 hour to cancel after placing it"". So ASOS are telling me I can't cancel an order I no longer want, and will have to wait for items to be dispatched out to me (in 8 days time), then once they've been delivered get them returned myself back to ASOS, then wait for them to receive them back, then wait up to another 5 days for a refund... What kind of company CAN'T CANCEL AN ORDER 8 days before delivering it?I complained that it didn't make sense for them to spend money sending something to me that I don't want, and then me have to send it back, so they said they'd escalate and call me back that day - which to be fair they did. On the call the staff member advised me that they would be able to cancel, but only once I get my dispatch notification and tracking information. Very polite, no issues I though.So I wait ALL weekend, then on Monday (3rd December 2018) contact them now I have the tracking number. I then get told I have to wait until it's active as the tracking number doesn't work just yet. Okay, fair enough I though. So I wait another 24 hours. Once tracking is now working I speak to them again ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY CANNOT CANCEL MY ORDER AGAIN!!!WHAT ON EARTH!I am now told I again have to wait for the items to arrive, then send them back myself. An order I DO NOT WANT.I've ordered many times with ASOS before and never had any real issues, but I will not be shopping with them again, and suggest others AVOID AVOID AVOID.By law, any customer purchasing online in the UK has LEGALLY got 14 days from delivery being made to them to cancel an order. And being told I cannot cancel until I have had the goods sent is just ridiculous. It literally makes no sense.Apologies for the rant, but I feel I should get my experience across - it's just anti-consumer and such a massive mess on. I guarantee it is like this in order to stress/confuse people into submission and into doing what ASOS want. They are not helpful at all!Await your response ASOS, but judging by your other reviews, I don't hold out any hope of getting a resolution and am resigned to not seeing my £110.99 until about 5 weeks time :(Gary

            Scam website, no customer care. Unfortunately didn't read the bad reviews about the company prior to having the bad experience myself. Please avoid ordering anything from them at any cost! Ordered a garment with a 20% black Friday discount and was checking the tracking link provided on the website on regular basis. Eventually on the estimated date of delivery I contacted ASOS and they told me the garment was in the DPD delivery point for the last 10 days and would be returned back to ASOS. I was advised to put another order and get a refund for the current one, but I wouldn't be entitled to a discount, despite the error being due to the lack of communication from ASOS and their service provider DPD. So long for customer care.

            Avoid ASOS!! No present for my mum's birthday, no outfit for Christmas party. Have been advised daily that parcel will be delivered next day for the last 4 days, no parcel each day! ASOS will not refund the parcel because it's out for delivery, despite it being put for delivery for 10 days. They've taken £70 for a parcel I'm not going to receive and are refusing to give a refund. Customer service is appalling and it will take 48hours for a manager to contact me. Absolute joke!!

            I paid for two day shipping and my order is not coming for a week. Ordered this thinking it would come in time for my formal and now I don't have a dress. To make things worse, they don't have a customer service phone number... Like are you kidding. Its the 21st century ASOS if you want to have better public relations improve your customer relations and don't lie about your shipping dates. Its quite literally false advertising as I got a confirmation email saying my package was expected for the next week right after I ordered even though I paid for the two day shipping. I honest to god hope someone takes this company to court. Would not recommend

            Just ordered on black Friday. Waited 8 days for my order which didn't arrive. Logged in to see what was taking so long and and said there was a problem with my order but not what. After two attempts using online chat they said problem with my card (there isn't I used it that day and every day since) but never told me this just left me waiting. The last thing I ordered off them went missing. Avoid this company like the plague. I agree with other reviewers. Sham company

            I placed my first ever order to ASOS for a pair of boots for my daughter. After completing the order, I realized a few days later I'd never received an email confirmation. Meanwhile my credit card was charged and posted for the total amount.  I got nowhere with two ASOS online chat help sessions. I was finally told my credit card had been denied and my order canceled, and I would receive credit in 10 business days. However, they were not able to explain to me how the credit card charge was posted and cleared if it was ""denied."" Based on my experience, I am NOT waiting for this ""refund"", as they claim no order even exists! I have initiated a dispute with my credit card. Meanwhile, the item is now out of stock, and I was unable to order it since they no longer had my daughter's size.  Oddly, I was texting my daughter about this whole thing while it was going on, and she went online (she is in another state) and ASOS showed availability in the boot in her size. What!?!  And no, it wasn't her cart that had taken what I wanted.  My end showed no availability before, during and after hers did. So I had her order it, but I don't trust that she will get them until I actually see them!  I will never order from them again.  UPDATE: I am upgrading my review to 3 stars (from 1 originally) because a very pleasant higher level customer service person called me today and she was finally able to tell me what had happened with my order. It turns out that my order did ship, and that the two agents with whom I'd previously chatted online had given me incorrect information. I am supposed to receive the boots in about a week, and I have since canceled my dispute with my credit card.  Because ASOS finally got it straightened out and gave me a discount code for my next purchase as a way of acknowledgment and apology, I give them an upgrade for getting to the bottom of it. Of course now I will have to return one pair but at least return shipping is free.

            First of all, it's the most reliable clothing web store, you will always take your ordered product on time without having issues. Also, fast shipping. Clothes are fresh. I have bought many clothes from here and yesterday I ordered some accessories, waiting for them in the next days. I have bought more than 20 products (including t-shirts, shirts, shoes, sunglasses, glasses, caps, jackets, bags, shocks). Just only one was not what I really expected and that was my first buy from asos one year ago it was a jacket, it was poor quality. But I gave a second chance to asos because I was watching fresh products day by day visiting the website and since then I was never disappointed again. Hope I will never be.

            I placed a large (over $200) order with ASOS 2 weeks ago. I purchased an outfit for a special upcoming event that I needed it for with plenty of time to spare. While this was the main reason for ordering from them, I also purchased some other things I liked. I paid to have my order shipped to my house by November 26th and on my order information, this was written by THEM very clearly. After my order didn't arrive on the 26th, I gave it a couple of days in hopes that maybe it was just delayed due to the holidays. Finally after 2 weeks of no tracking updates, I called the tracking company to see where my package was. They informed me that ASOS never sent them the package. After multiple attempts to contact ASOS with no luck, I was finally sent an email that ""there were complications with my order"" and that I would be reimbursed. Well now I have no outfit for my event, I still haven't been reimbursed, and the last person who I talked to via online chat (Rhia) rudely sent me a link to reorder all of my items (which I haven't been reimbursed for nor received) and then she left the chat without any further assistance. Finally I decided to bite the bullet and just place a completely new order of all the items I never received but paid for, and they were out of stock in my size in 4 of the items. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from ASOS ever again and would not recommend anyone chance going through this process with a company of such awful customer service.

            The service I have recently received from ASOS has been awful. I usually don't have a problem with them until recently. Since they are only located in the UK and I am in the US, I have had to use their online chat service to talk to their customer reps and man was I given the run around.  My package was very late and still hasn't arrived and I was given mixed dates and lied to about getting a refund on the original date.Recently after contacting them after the fourth time, I eventually got a email saying I should receive a refund within 5-10 days. Since I have been lied to previously, I am not sure. Hopefully this ordeal can hurry up and be over with.

            I ordered a purse from ASOS, I was super excited to get it and wear it to the club. I waited and I waited. The estimate delivery date flew by and still no purse. I decide to message the company asking where my package was and they sent it TO THE WRONG F*CKIN ADDRESS. Then they attempted to blame it on me saying that I made the mistake, but why would I confuse myself and put an address I’ve never been to instead of the address I have lived at for almost 4 years? Anyways. They never admitted to their mistake nor even attempted to fix the problem. And for about a month and a half I’ve been getting the run around for a refund. They told me to wait a month to see if it just magically shows up at my address and then another month to ensure that I haven’t gotten it. I still haven’t gotten my refund. This website must be run by an amateur(s) who clearly don’t know how online shopping works. In a nutshell, this company is trash that will send your package to the wrong address, blame it on you and refuse to give you back your hard earned money! STAY AWAY!

            Asos has gone to the dogs. I don't know who they have hired in their 'customer service' department but it is a complete disgrace. Asos are fond of tricking you with 'express delivery' which will never come on time. Do not rely on them for an important occasion. They also may send you the wrong item if the item you are looking for is going out of stock quickly just so they can make a sale. Waste of time returning some hideous pyjama set when you ordered a summer dress. Disgustingly careless organisation.

            Placed an order with premium next day delivery to a DPD collection point. Order sent back by DPD with message saying can't delivery to any address other than billing address. ASOS live chat fobs me off with 'please wait 7 days for the order to be returned so we can process and refund then you can place a new order'. After much back and forth I get an email saying the delivery never left ASOS and they are sending a new order (minus 2 items that are now out of stock) which will be delivered to the same collection point the next day. Well, today is the next day and what do you know... I get the same 'order sent back by DPD' email so again I get on ASOS live chat to be given the same cookie cutter response of wait 7 days blah blah blah. So, to summarise, like most peoples experience, if you order their stuff and it arrives then you probably think they're great. However, if you order their stuff and it doesn't arrive... well, the reviews speak for themselves. I imagine after several further chat and email conversations I'll eventually get a refund for the order, by which time the remaining items will likely be out of stock too.

In my case, I have contacted them 5 times already since I placed my order with the fast delivery service on 11th Nov, because I dont get any update on the tracking number that they provided, and today 28th Nov they are just telling me that my parcel is already with the courier and I should wait at least until the 3rd Dec for them to be able to do something about it in case I havent received my parcel by that time. Not to mention that every time I speak to someone different from the CS Team, she/he tells me a differrent story... any way, when I complained and said that I wasnt happy about the situation, the customer service rep just said that I had to wait a bit more and closed the chat inmediately...

            Pay attention to the terms and conditions of promotion code.I used the 30% off code and did not notice the full terms of the code (because it's too long!!!)I returned a £17 item of the order (the whole order is  £56, after applying the code, it's  £39.2), but only got £0.2 refund. Because in the terms, it says that if the items you kept are below the minimum value applying this code, they will be reverted to full price. So the refund = value of the items returned - discount = 17-16.8=0.2These terms and conditions are not reasonable and never happened on other online platforms. And you should really be careful to read the terms and policy.

            Just an update - after i made the original review i send an Email to ASOS with my claim. Within 6 hours i think we had come to a solution. Don't know if i where lucky or the department at the emails are more competent than the Chat people which i had the displeasure of chatting with for an un-constructive hour. The below (original review) i still stand buy in regard to their chat service:Their items might be quite all right and maybe even cheap, but their customer support can only be described as tragic. You dont know if you are talking to a human or a monkey pressing buttons generating random and uncorrelated answers... If you get a good deal buy from them, just be prepared for the most tragic and unhelpful experience of your life if you need to contact them, and i am saying this after my girlfriend dumped me last week.

            DO NOT SHOP WITH THIS COMPANY!!!Bought some items thinking is was free shipping and returns. Turns out living here is the US i have to now pay DHL $212 because of customs which i was definitely not made aware of. I was sent the bill from DHL 2 months after my return and had no idea it was coming. Contacted ASOS and they say the cant do anything. Avoid this company at all cost.

            I don’t know why, their systemia worst. I just ordered the robes by using my card normally. But it is cancelled with no notification, I just found out after two days of order. The reason was realky funny, the ‘card’ was expired so it is cancelled. It was really funny because I was using my card as usual even after order and the year of expire was 2019. Maybe, its time to say goodbye with ASOS, because there is a lot of online shopping center. 😉

            I ordered an item on ASOS at the start of October and come Thanksgiving, I still had not received the item. I emailed them asking why it hadn't arrived yet, and they had just forgotten to send it at all. I think it's unacceptable that they charged my card and then simply forgot to send me the merchandise. I contacted customer service asking for a refund, but they would not give me one. Instead, they said they shipped the item out to me already, so in order to get a refund I would have to return the item myself. By this time, it's already too cold to wear the item I ordered, which was ordered when it was 30 degrees warmer. I have to make the extra effort to ship them back an item that they had forgotten to send me in the first place, and they didn't even say sorry or offer ANYTHING.

I have been waiting for my parcel for 1 week+  past the stipulated delivery date and all the service team is telling me is to wait another day each time I ask for an update as to where my package is and when will it be arriving. Do you think your customers are fools? Please give me my refund immediately and improve your ridiculous service.

            Hidden charges and potential delaysOrdered some items to be sent internationally and annoying ASOS does not include all custom charges in their costs. They even decided to split one of my larger orders into two parcels which then incurred two import charges, even though they assured me that one order regardless of how many parcels will incur only one import charge. I contacted ASOS re this and was told to chase customs even though this happened because they decided to put it into two parcels. Regardless, they were the ones that submitted the documentation to customs so in my opinion they should be the ones calling customs and going through that headache. Another annoyance is that the payment of these fees delayed the shipment. Luckily, I was in country and received the email but this may not be the case for others.The fact that there are additional hidden fees is not acceptable for such a large company. I frequently shop online with majority of purchases being sent from overseas and have not experienced this before.

            I am a loyal customer and have used ASOS for many years but they have gone downhill significantly. I had a nightmare with a recent order that I made over a month ago, firstly DPD had lost the parcel that was worth over £50. They sent the order back out which was kind of them, however, before they did this I reordered the items myself. So when I received the missing order, I returned everything as I already had it. They didn't refund me the full amount and claim that I didn't return one item which I already had, therefore did not need TWO! To top it all off they will no do anything about it. I am now £20 out of pocket. If you ever use ASOS order things separately and will take pictures of everything. It's ridiculous.

            I have used ASOS for years and I dread to think how much money I’ve spent with them in the past....They’ve recently changed their courier to DPD (UK Mail) for my area and I’m disgusted. Ordered my parcel 9 days ago next day delivery and I still haven’t received it (over £100 worth of clothes). I selected ‘deliver to neighbour’ which the delivery driver was incapable off. I then got a slip through the door to say it had been delivered to a shop (2 miles away) after making my own way there twice it wasn’t there. Lots and lots of emails, phone calls to DPD and live chats later I still haven’t got my parcel. I’ve been informed there was an issue with the parcel and it was damaged however I am no closer to getting a refund or getting it delivered. I’m disgusted and annoyed about the amount of time I have spent trying to resolve this situation and as a loyal customer how they have treated me.

            One of their couriers lost my parcel and they're making replacements/refunds as awkward as possible by refusing a replacement or refund until they feel like it (if they feel like it at all).

Had thrown away all packaging tags etc as you would if you were to keep the item.  Contacted ASOS online and sent photos requested a refund and was told to wait for three days.  On the third day, nothing! Contacted ASOS via messenger as the online chat was not great.  I was informed that they had sent another jacket to me and emailed me yesterday.  I checked all my email folders, no email from them of course!  I requested a refund again and said I didn’t want another jacket!  They told me that I would need to wait until mid Dec to receive the replacement jacket then send them both back?!  Alll for their faulty product and broken promise?! I don’t think so.

            I have been a customer of Asos for around 10 years and am continuously let down by their service, particularly their customer service. I have never formally complained to Asos before and have ‘just got on with it’. However my most recent experience I had with them was extremely poor and therefore I decided to contact the customer service team by phone and email this time with my complaint and I have not heard anything back from them and that was over 2 weeks ago - 4 emails sent. My next day delivery parcel was late which I would not have complained about as long as they reimbursed me for delivery costs however Asos were unable to tell me when my parcel would be delivered and told me I would just have to wait and see. As I was going away I cancelled the order and was reassured it would be cancelled. £500 + was withdrawn from my account and the parcel is missing. Due to the size of the organisation, you would think they would have a better and more helpful customer service team.  Appalling service.

            I only shop at ASOS and have always had no issues. I received a faulty item which tore at the seams and they had no more in stock so I opted to return. I did so through the “To You” in my local supermarket. Process was slower than using post office but then I hadn’t heard anything a week later. Contacted them and the customer service rep was very rude. I told her the tracking status said it was with them but she insisted I had to wait 7 working days. I asked to speak to a manager and repeatedly asked for my complaint to be escalted but was ignored. Waited until the 7th working day and was then told I had to wait until the end of the day and if I hadn’t received an email get back in touch. Very generic responses and not helpful at all. Contacted on the 8th working day and was told it’s now been passed to a “specialist team” and it would take a further 3 working days! Again I tried to complain and apparently ASOS do not have a complaints policy or procedure. Ridiculous. It will now be Monday before I get a decision on a refund- 14 days after posting the item which was evidently lost by the 3rd day after posting. What I don’t underestand is if I could prove I posted the faulty item why couldn’t they just refund me straight away? So frustrating.

            My first time ordering from ASOS was completely and utterly disappointing. Made an order on 10nov, shipped on 11nov with a promised est. delivery on 19novGreat since I needed my stuff before 23nov!19nov passed, I didn’t receive a single shït. I contacted asos only to be told that there was a delay in their carrier and I’ll definitely receive my long awaited items before 22novI held on to that promise but was met with “in transit” from 13nov till now (23nov) 22nov passed, a friend who made her order a day after me had already received her purchases, her parcel status updated perfectly normal – step by stepI of course went on to contact asos yet again to question on the frozen status of my parcel on the very same day, was again told to give it some time and wait till the end of the day to contact them Thing is, my local courier stops delivering after 6pm! I have repeatedly mentioned this to their team but was always placated with the same generic response. When 22nd nov torturously ended, I went to chat with asos team againIt was only then that they admitted they had lost my parcel All these could have been shortened to a mere adimittance and an email from asos’ teamI now have to wait for a “specialist” to email me within 3days It’s unfortunately a huge sale season right nowIf asos decides to send me another parcel, won’t I still have to expect long delays and very possible loss of parcels? I can only hope they’ll be generous and professional enough to provide express delivery to make up for their empty promises Let’s see if they can live up to their promises

            Paid extra for next day delivery. Received the order four days later. ASOS won't compensate the charge, saying it's 'out of their hands' when orders are delivered. That's fine if next day delivery is free, but when you pay extra for a service you don't receive, that's theft. When you cannot provide the service you're advertising to customers at extra charge, that's fraud. ASOS have, by far, the worst customer service ever. Even beyond companies that I've taken to court in the past. Unsurprisingly, over the past year the value of the company has plummeted and I hope it continues to do so.

In my last order I did not receive one of items (which happened to be the most expensive in the order). I did not stress and followed the help section on the ASOS website, which specifically provides assistance with “missing items”.

            So the first problem is, they used DPD to deliver my parcel which obviously means it wasn’t delivered on time despite me paying for next day delivery. Secondly, the clothes from the asos brand are of horrifying quality. I bought a dress and two buttons fell off whilst i was trying it on. The quality of the material is cheap and impractical.You will probably have to buy a size up if for some reason you do decide to order from the asos collection. I’m very dissatisfied and will not be ordering from their brand again

            ordered a parcel 2 days ago using next day delivery, and I would just like to say how terrible shocking customer service I have received. order:368793019. I am disgusted. 3 live chats with different people yesterday and 2 today, all people saying the same thing, copying and pasting there answers. 'Now, I have ordered from another site who used the courier Hermes and I have just received that order fine asked the driver and he said no more delivers or drivers are due to this building today meaning......my package isnt coming today even though I ordered 2 days ago with next day delivery, please can someone accept this is lost and send me out a new parcel.' thats what is add to the live chat person and she ended the chat. the parcel isnt coming and I want a refund and no one will action this.

            Deliberate sabotage. I have purchased from ASOS multiple times and the most recent order was quite a large order of five items totaling $420. After discount I paid slightly above $290, which allowed me to enjoy express shipping. The order was placed on the 12th of November 2018. A few days later, I received notification from the shipping company that stated that my items could be taxed. According to my country’s tax policy, I can import tax-free, up to $400. Beyond that, I will be taxed 7% goods and services tax. ASOS had sabotaged me by declaring the five items a whopping $471.01! That’s malicious and unethical. I didn’t buy that much nor paid remotely close to this figure. Jeez. But this was quickly resolved by me when I forwarded them the correct invoice. But guess what. Today, 21st of November, my item is still sailing the slow boat to me. The tracking just reflected that it’s been shipped. That’s two slap of my face. Over declaration and slow shipment. You guys and gals decide if this is worth the aggravation.

            ASOS recently started using a new delivery company called Gnewt. This company’s services are abismal. They allegedly attempt to deliver the parcel on 3 occasions however, they did not once leave an attempted delivery slip and I can see online that they did these 3 “attempts” were all around the same time on 3 consecutive workdays. Taking into account that most people work 9 to 5 I think it would have been only natural for gnewt to have let me rearrange the delivery after one failed delivery attempt rather than continue to try delivering my parcel at the same time the next 2 days. They also never contacted me to say that a delivery was attempted and it had failed, it was up to me to keep checking their tracking services to find this out. They also did not attempt to leave my package with my next door neighbour on any of the 3 occasions and he was home for all 3 deliveries as he is a pensioner. They also never informed me that my parcel was being returned to ASOS, on their online tracking it does say ""RTS"" which I know realise it means Return to Seller however there is no explanation of what this acronym means on their website. This is by far my worst experience with a delivery service, they do not make their costumers' life easy and seem unable to accommodate for anything.Althought ASOS costumer service was responsive, they did not take the issue seriously and simply said I can reorder if I want.Online shopping should be a fun and exciting experience, Gnewt is managing to turn this into a stressful and ""hope for the best"" experience.

            Good when there isn't any issues with your order, terrible when there is. Bought a coat from them which arrived damaged, it was sent back the very next day and upon receipt by ASOS they issued me a refund (the same day it arrived) - however they didn't issue the full amount.After getting through to support (with seemingly no way to call and speak directly) i was advised I'd have to wait 3 days to get my missing part of the refund looked into. So, they can receive an order and issue a refund on the same day it gets delivered, however they need 3 days to get the missing part of the refund looked into and they on top of that i have to wait for the rest to clear into my account.Not a very good customer support IMO, why it takes 3 days to look into a refund issue (when the system should show them direct how much was issued already) is beyond me.

Useless CS team on Facebook and Twitter keep telling me to wait different dates. When the date comes they are telling me to wait until another date. It's been two weeks since my parcels should have arrived and the useless advisers are sending automated standard responses. I've messaged them so much now that they're ignoring me. Don't know where to go from here.Yes you can get nice clothes but there is no point ordering from them because as soon as there's a problem it turns into a nightmare. I will avoid at all costs.

            This company is a JOKE. My order was supposed to arrive on 18/11/18 and prior to that I had used to online tracking service which they provide to ""enable customers to know the whereabouts of their items"". Placed the order on 10/11/18 and they stopped updating the status on 16/11/18. (So since then till now, 20/11/18, the status has been stuck at ""in-transit"".) On 18/11/18, I decided to go on their live chat and ask for assistance in checking the whereabouts of my order and all they could tell me was to ""Wait till the end of the day, if you haven't received it by then, we will look into it for you"". Mind you, I tried asking multiple times and all 4 CSO gave me the same reply. Fine, I waited it out and surprise surprise my order wasn't delivered on the promised date. So I tried getting assistance from the live chat again, one CSO completely ignored me, the next told me that there was nothing she could do to check the whereabouts of my order other than the same online tracking page customers go to as it isn't updated by asos but by the courier itself. She then proceeded to tell me to give it till 27/11/18.  So here's my question, why did I have to wait it out when all you're gonna tell me is what I see on the online tracking page?? ASOS PLEASE. But that's not the worse part, the worse part is when I was explaining my side of the story to this CSO called Devinia (i think that's how it's spelt), telling her my frustrations and how the live chat hasn't been helpful thus far, she said ""Please refrain from using abusive language"". Oh my god. Jesus. Lord help me. Never in any one of the chats had I used abusive language so you can imagine how taken aback I was. It's one thing to not be able to solve a customer's problem, but a whole other to just blatantly accuse them of something they did not do? Asos, please get it together.

            Have ordered a few times and delivery has arrived before the expected date which was a nice surprise. Found it easy to return the items that didn't quite fit, which is super useful when ordering online as you never know how the clothes look on you until you actually try them on. Took the parcel to the Post Office and pretty much the next day got an email from ASOS saying my refund was being processed and got my money back shortly after that. Will be ordering again given the ease and convenience, knowing I can return items that are the wrong size

            Bury custom information in the FAQ section about charges for Sunglasses.  They do NOT make it clear when checking out that 1. They are not shipping from their US warehouse to US customers and 2. That the ONLY category incurring customs charges (sunglasses) are being sent from UK, not the US with their free 2-day shipping.  I didn't even know things could get from UK to California in 2 days.  Now I'm paying $195 for $94 sunglasses that I could have purchases from a reputable company in US.

            I have shopped on Asos for years and very rarely have I had any issues regarding delivery..until recently. I placed an order on 30th October and as a premier customer I receive next day delivery all year round. However it is now the 18th November and I still haven’t received my parcel. I checked the tracking on Hermes and it said I had to take action and contact Asos, which I did. I emailed Asos and within 24 hours they responded saying that I had to contact Hermes as Asos ‘weren’t able to contact them directly’. Even though the delivery of the parcel is the responsibility of Asos, I contacted Hermes but could only reach an automated system which told me that Asos cancelled the courier services on the 7th November. I then emailed Asos customer care again on the 14th November explaining this and as of the 17th I had no reply. I tried to contact Asos on Facebook messenger which says I should have a response within a few hours. Just under 24 hours later they responded asking for my registered email address so they could look into this further and after sending my email address no one has got back to me again. The order was for over £130 and I am appalled at the customer service, or lack of.I will be taking this to small claims court if it is not resolved within the next week.

In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. Any outstanding returns will still be processed when the order reaches the warehouse, you’ll receive notification of this. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.Best Wishes,Customer Verification TeamASOS Customer CareI can't believe how rude this is, what terrible service and very insulting,beware if using this company my advise would be to avoid at all cost.

            I have shopped with ASOS for years now but whenever there is a problem they make it stressful to resolve the issue. I recently purchased a pair of shoes which they delivered in a bashed up bag with no box or return label. The shoes were tiny for a size 4 so I sent them back after going through the hassle of getting a new label from the Royal Mail. Due to my printer being broke this became difficult as I had to go to a particular post office to get a returns label (something ASOS should have provided) this has then resulted in the item getting lost in the returns process and asos happily keeping my money! I tried messaging the customer service team to resolve the issue, which they were very unhelpful!

            I keep going back to ASOS because their range is so good, but their customer service is absolutely AWFUL. Their entire approach to any issue is to say ‘ah well too bad, thanks anyway’. They have zero interest in resolving issues or being helpful, and instead just quote terms and conditions and won’t budge on anything. They really couldn’t care less about their customers. Their trade turnover must be so high it just doesn’t matter to them whether you’re happy or not. Next!

            Used ASOS a lot in the past with minimal issues but the last 2 orders have been ridiculous. My last order took 2 weeks to arrive which was annoying but not the end of the world. My most recent order was cancelled without them telling me, I even received an email the day after it was apparently cancelled telling me it had been dispatched. Unacceptable to start with.After emailing them 4 days after my parcel was due they told me it had been canceled because it was out of stock...all 4 items that I ordered apparently. After checking the website only 1 of the 4 things is actually out of stock. So basically they just couldn't be bothered to send the 3 items and refund one of them.In the email process I told them I wanted some sort of compensation for messing me around for a week and adding to the stress of Christmas shopping as I now have to do it again. They gave me a 10% discount code as I had originally used one on my order...It was a student discount code that I use on every order to really it was a useless discount code.Then to annoy me even more, I went to order the 3 items that were still in stock again and the £13 credit I used to buy it has not been refunded to my account despite telling me that it has been.

            Honestly THE WORST customer experience I have ever had. Ordered my parcel, didnt arrive on the day it said - package showed 'in depot' but not having left with courier. Informed I would have to wait until midnight for them to do something. Emailed the next day. Ok - thanks for letting us know, now wait a week before we can do anything. WHAT?So, in the meantime I contact the parcel delivery company, ascertain my parcel has been deemed lost (after hours waiting in a queue, being told to wait 48 hours etc..) I then let ASOS know that Hermes have officially deemed it lost and told me to let the parcel sender know...SO I now send an email saying, if its been confirmed lost can you do something? Emailed back saying, yes please provide proof. Send screenshot. Email back says, thanks for this but actually you are going to have to wait a week either way. (Each email is sent to a new person, so they are all saying different things). OKKKKK I wait until the week has passed - GREAT NOW CAN YOU LOOK INTO IT? Yes, thanks for your email - has been passed on to a specialist team, please wait 48 HOURS. Hear back from them - sorry, can't send new stuff for half your items as we are NOW OUT OF STOCK. YAYOK, I want to speak to someone and complain - 'we aren't a call centre so you can't - hope this experience doesn't turn you away from shopping with us in the future'. WHAT A TOTAL JOKE. BOYCOTT.

            I've used ASOS since the beginning and never experienced any problems. For the 1st time last month Hermes lost my parcel and it was a nightmare and I was a little concerned as after many emails I was told I would need to contact ASOS to get my refund or parcel resent and after reading some of the reviews have to say wasn't sure if this would get sorted. Spoke to a lovely lady called Beth on live chat and she was very helpful and said I should hear back in 48 hours well I heard back later that day and all sorted. They've sent another parcel out and delivery will be today so very happy!

            Don't waste your time buying clothes from ASOS. They are poorly made, don't fit properly and their process on how they do their refunds leaves a lot to be desired. Also good luck trying to contact them as you have to do that by online chat and they fob you off because they don't really care.  This was my first and last time shopping with them.  On the plus side I did order two gorgeous jumpsuits from ""The Iconic"" and received them within 3 day. The whole process was seamless and went off without a hitch. #amazing #winning #Illbeback

            Used to be quite pleased with my orders and kept buying clothing for the whole family every couple of months, since selection is generally quite wide and good. I was first very pleased when they started co-operating with Klarna. Slowly noticed that name label quality went downhill and communication/marketing to customers was very unpleasant, not at all personalized and didn't feel valued as a customer. Now very silently and surprisingly they added a return fee of 10€ from Finland and that seemed unfair only because it was poorly communicated to customers. If I place 5-8 orders per year and spend quite a lot of my shopping budget to the company, surely they could at least inform customers about this kind of changes.Congrats Zalando! My ASOS spending can now be directed at you.

            Now I understand those low reviews, If i could give you 0 starts I would.I don't know why customer service is even called like that. No help at all, i order my premier deliver package and it hasn't been delivered 3 times, once courier lied he attempted delivery, second it didn't even went out to delivery and 3rd on the way to Local Pickup it hasn't cause it was refused for some reason. ASOS CS could not establish why and when my package will be delivered. They don't cancel the orders either so now I need to wait for parcel to return to them. No compensation for my time and nerves I lost over this. You are joke ASOS, I don't understand why you still on the market!

            Used to purchase from them for many years without problems. Had no issues with returning items, cancelling orders or refunds. However, I had to return an item I made in my recent purchase as the fit was small.Currently returns from Singapore has changed to Aramex instead of Singapore Post. So I chose Aramex Home Collection, just schedule a pickup and pass it along to the deliveryman. Simple? No.Deliveryman did not turn up at all while I was home the whole day. Contacted Asos on the next working day and the customer service officer told me they had no contact with ARAMEX. and I had to contact them myself. Why then did they ask to contact ASOS when you need help? They are not helpful at all. Rescheduled another pick up today but NO SIGN OF DELIVERY MAN AT ALL. Such nonsense. Quote from email: ""Amending your collection:If you need to change your collection date, or if you have missed the driver then please contact ASOS"", ""If you need any assistance please contact ASOS""Aramex has really bad ratings and is unreliable. Makes it really difficult to return items now. Definitely won't be shopping here as there are better websites that have faster delivery time and easier return methods.Update: Delivery man from Aramex did not turn up for rescheduled pick up

            Although I have shopped with ASOS for a couple of years now, I'm not very happy with my recent experiences. Ordered two dresses 3 weeks ahead of an event – one was lost and delivered nearly a month later, the other was never really in stock. Another dress was recently missing a belt. Now I find out they've quietly dropped free returns to Finland and I'm left in the stink with a slightly ill-fitting dress made by their own label out of the cheapest fabric I've seen in a while. Customer service has been anemic nearly every time. Probably won't do business again – simply won't pay €10 to return a €50 dress.

            Like others, I'm having the same shipping issues. Trying to chat with humans who have been trained by bots. Credit card charged 11/1/18. Rep said order would be received by end of day on 11/9/18. It's now 11/12/18. Chat Bot says now to wait until end of day 11/13/18.  The shipping info seems bogus, there are NO tracking numbers. Says order arrived in US on 11/3/2018. That was 9 days ago. Chat bots keep telling me to check back. I don't have the time. Will dispute charge & never order from ASOS again. I suspect the order was never shipped. UPDATE: I filed a dispute with Paypal and my $$$ was refunded that day. It's 11/14/18 and STILL NO ORDER. I think this company is a scam. They charge your card & don't ship the order or ship the wrong items. They assume you won't have the time to make a fuss, especially with such poor customer service.

            Asos wasted so much of my time. insisted that there is a delay for my delivery and did not want to assist me further on my issue. The gift was meant to be a birthfay gift but right now the plan is ruin. After waiting for 2 weeks, they send an email saying that the item is ""out of stock"" and will refund me . When i go back to ASOS website, the exact damn item is ""low in stock"" and i could still add it to my bag. I believe ASOS messed my order up and decided to give me a LOUSY excuse that the item is out of stock. On top of that, after wasting so much time waiting for my item that hasnt even been shipped out, I also incurred exchange rate loss as the amount that will be refunded is lower than what i have paid for. IF YOU DO NOT MIND WASTING YOUR OWN TIME AND POSSIBLY YOUR MONEY, THEN SHOP WITH ASOS :))))

            I had bought a couple dresses and a pair of shoes for an event. Carefully reading reviews and sizing. When I got the package, NOTHING FIT. Too big and too small. I went about all of the return instructions carefully. Paid the money to send them back, also paid all the duty when the package had arrived. The whole incident costing just shy of 300 dollars. They received my package and claimed a refund would be issued in 10-21 business days. I HAVE NOT RECIEVED ANY MONEY IN MONTHS. Contacting the company was an absolute nightmare, and they asked to see my bank statement ? Showing I did not receive the money ? So for 21 days they want to see my transactions?

I used to praise them and I wonder if they have changed staff/customer service provider recently as I have had endless problems! Over the past few months (I use them a lot as I hate physically shopping and paid for ASOS premier a while back, but going to delete their app now) I have experienced lost parcels, dispatched emails when items not actually dispatched, refunds for new orders with no explanation, wrong sizes, refunded incorrect amounts, refunded for some items but others lost by asos - every time their online chat insinuates its my fault!!! The twitter team seem to be a little better but still no one seems to ever understand why these issues are annoying and no one seems to care - there is no sense of urgency and they are happy to hold onto your money while constantly telling you to ‘wait another 48 hours’!

At one point, the agent I was chatting with began insinuating that it was my problem even through the error was in their own system and its integration with their delivery partner. In addition, the fact that they do not have a call center clearly shows that they have no interest in investing in customer satisfaction. Needless to say, the entire experience is one that makes it not worth shopping on this website.

I explained the situation that Hermes made no attempt to deliver my parcel but they have just repeatedly sent me the same copy and pasted response telling me that I need to wait till the 9th before they can track it for me. Meanwhile Hermes are also completely ignoring me though they’re notoriously absolute w*nkers so I dunno why I’m shocked. I even sent my tracking info over to ASOS to show that for 9 days it hasn’t been updated. They don’t know where my parcel is, they won’t answer my questions, they wouldn’t let me have the parcel delivered to a different address and they are claiming they can’t contact Hermes, been absolutely disgraceful customer service for this entire experience and I’m not going to bother ordering from them again as they’ve been SO unwilling to help me at all

Even more appalled that ASOS say they cannot do anything about this, cannot get them to send it to a nearby click and collect store nor to use the written instructions I provided. So instead, I am meant to re-order everything, hope it is all in stock, and pay for a further order, when ASOS won't even refund me for almost 3 weeks! Its a shoddy service. Can't trust them or their couriers. I have tried to go through their customer service team but just get told the same thing repeatedly. Nothing they can do?! I will be telling everyone I know not to bother taking the risk on ASOS for Christmas, birthday presents or any orders they might actually need because they'll simply be out of pocket and nothing will arrive, or if it does, not even on time. Reading all other recent emails, it sounds like you're doing this to a lot of customers lately. I wonder whether ASOS are about to go into administration hence the refusal to repay out of pocket customers. Don't use them

So i ordered a pair of chunky heeled boots and the package came on time within a few days which I was pleased with. However, when the parcel arrived they had sent out a huge faux fur coat instead. The item code and description was on the delivery slip for the shoes and even the sticker on the plastic bag for the coat was for the shoes, so i cant imagine how this mix up happened. I then went on to live chat with the customer service and told them i wanted a refund and did not want the shoes sent out anymore. They then said it would take 'up to three days' for them to send an email to me explaining how to go about returning it. I then received the email and it did explain that I should send the item back and should they not be able to refund the product they would 'let me know', this issue has yet to be resolved and i hope that they will sort this issue out promptly once the coat arrives to them. However, I very unhappy with the seemingly lazy and 'not really bothered' way they dealt with this issue. I expected more from this company and after trying them out for the first time I can honestly just say  I am left feeling quite annoyed.

            I ordered over $300 worth of merchandise though ASOS, the parcel came in time however when I got it all the sizes were wrong. Not only that but the material of the clothing felt flimsy and fake. So I decided to return my parcel. I sent my parcel back over a month ago. Paid 112 dollars worth in shipping fees ""which they said they do not pay for when it clearly states on their website they do"" and they have still not received it. I'm upset over the fact that this company has basically taken their merchandise back and also 400 dollars from me. I have not been refunded and have contacted support teams which either do not respond for days on end or completely dismiss my situation. I would recommend never buying anything from this company  as it is easily the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. Absolute scam artists

            What has happened to ASOS?! I remembered a time when they used to be good.  For my recent purchases-  they sent me the wrong sizes.  Instead of sorting it out, I get a message saying ‘we’ll be in touch in the next 3 days with an update for you’.  Really surprised by the poor service.  I used to be a regular customer because of its efficiency and reliability, but the service has definitely declined.  Unlikely to purchase anything from them again.

            I returned a faulty item over a week ago and can’t get a straight answers from anyone as to my refund. It’s £95 that they owe me. The chat line is awful they just fob you off. I tried email clearly stating the order number and they keep talking about another order.  I am clearly not talking about that order. The order numbers are totally different. I think they are trying to get out of paying me in which case I bloody want my item back but where is it? They can’t even tell me that. So they have potentially lost my item and won’t be giving me my money? Apparently there is no complaints department which is unheard of and I have to wait 3 days for a specialist team to get back to me. Ridiculous. Will not be shopping here again.

            Terrible customer service. I booked a collection from Hermes and the item did not get collected. Wasted my whole day. The following day I report this this to Asos and they just said print another label and do it all over again - no apology no nothing. No investigation as to why this happened.So I  just produce and print countless return labels and no one comes to pick it up or do anything about it.Then the quality of the Asos shoes is shocking, the worst thing ever. They came apart two days after wearing them.

            As someone that has shopped with Asos for years (we’re talking 4-5) I’m disappointed with their service over the past few months. “Next day” deliveries always fail to arrive on time, especially since they’ve started using Hermes over DPD, why would you even bother to use Hermes? They’re a terrible company! Customer services handle most complaints very poorly. I recently returned an order as an exchange due to being sent the wrong size and instead of being sent the correct item I was refunded... despite the desired size being in stock. The loss of A-list is a major disappointment too, it was definitely something that had me coming back month after month. At this moment in time, they don’t really offer anything more than your average online retailer, if anything, it’s much less. I’ll be shopping elsewhere until they work harder to regain customer loyalty... and their delivery services.

            Never shopping from here again. Returned a jumper to purchase it in a smaller size. The reason I couldn't send it back as an exchange is because the size kept going out of stock. So I purchased my size and sent it back. When I placed the order I received £10 off for the whole order, but my refund deducted the full £10 for one jumper. Contacted customer service for them to say they couldn't resolve the issue.

They just have better stuff for incredible prices and the quality you can’t compare with shops around you. People here complaining about shippings should realise the shipping is provided by the post offices - which can be tricky at times, but the Asos customer service is very quick to react and no complaints there.Refunds are easy to deal with too. Recomend them 100%!

            Asos has always been my go to and I have been a premier customer for many years. However in the last few months I’ve had parcels not turn up, turn up in the middle of the night or just to be chucked over my back gate during various hours of the night/morning. After this I’ve grown fed up and have complained to Asos after a parcel I had ordered didn’t turn up. I had no notification of delays and asos’s Customer care was bloody shocking. They essentially said ‘not our problem’ I received automated responses, different details on when to actually expect my parcel and no form of an apology.

They repeat the same answer again and again, regardless of any arguments you bring. I think the good reviews are in case you don’t get in touch with any support function - if the order leaves on time and everything is in good condition. Otherwise, good luck speaking with anyone from there.Via 10 emails they gave me the same answer over and over again. Besides, they don’t even know how transportation work, who does deliveries until midnight??

            this company cannot be trusted. I placed an order for next day delivery and it was a day late (with no warning)... It turns out my order was incomplete.. with THREE items out of the SIX I ordered not in my package.. ASOS are now reviewing my case and I’ve had no updates. Not to mention Lewis who works in the call centre in Glasgow who lied to me over the phone. Jasmin and Nimo on online chat were nice but basically just told me to phone DPD (wasting more of my own time) and to suck it up and wait.. I honestly don’t know what has happened to ASOS recently, their customer service used to be spot on now they’re treating me like a criminal.

            I ordered a lot of make up through you (roughly £100 worth) and it never arrived in my parcel. I provided photos showing that the parcel had been opened and then resealed by DPD but you still haven’t helped refund me or resend me the items. Originally you said you would come back to me after 5 working days, I then followed up and on the 5th working day and you said to leave it to the next day. I’ve now followed up every single day since then and you keep repasting the same message stating you’ll let me know when there’s an update. It’s now been nearly 2 weeks since I notified you of this and it’s really frustrating that you’re not sticking to your own deadlines or trying to help me in anyway at all. Typically I would expect with good customer service that you would refund or replace the items and then you can follow up with your partner DPD rather than waiting for a response from them before helping your customer. I regularly buy from ASOS and have been a customer for a number of years and I feel your level of service has significantly decreased over the last couple of years. I now find it very unreliable and also unhelpful when there’s a problem and would now find myself questioning whether I would recommend using your company due to the lack of care if anything goes wrong. I hope that I will receive some kind of suitable resolution to my recent order but to anyone reading this please think twice about whether you want to order from ASOS as this is not the only time this has happened.

            I am new to ASOS and read reviews here before buying. I found the website easy to navigate maybe helped by knowing exactly what I wanted. As I had a discount code I was expecting an issue ( these codes either work or not and, if the latter, it is usually presumed that the customer is at fault. Rarely will the retailer admit to/accept the fault being theirs. But that’s another issue). WOW! The discount code was accepted and the ease of placing the order & paying raised a smile on my face. I got updates and the goods were received CAREFULLY & WELL PACKAGED and in pristine condition. The order price was competitive so that influenced my purchase. I like a good deal! My reason for 4 stars being that delivery was slower than competitors standard /free delivery, and the amount of card & paper in the parcel was unnecessary and expensively produced. Would be better to save money using a ‘print if needed’ returns system and use savings to improve other areas or offer more customer discounts or plant a tree ( if you don’t do that already). Just a suggestion from an average customer 🤔 I will buy again.

            Customer since the beginning of as seen on screen I am satisfied with my purchases, customer service, returns and so on.But I'm aware that , although the offer is vast, the quality of ASOS made products leaves a lot to be desired. Of course you get what you paid for, cheap ! Also I find that Asos has lost its lustre by providing merchandise not so exciting as before, stuff that one can just find anywhere on line. I suggest that asos should hire streets ahead buyers, because going through the massive stuff on site, it's difficult to find something that stands out and worth buying, just me of course.  I lately got a pair of of Allsaints cigarette jeans, a winner. Thanx.

            Customer Service? What's that? I really don't know how ASOS choose to hire their staff. I've to explain a refund issue over and over again because the refund was made incorrectly in the first place by ASOS. It took over 45 minutes and in the end, Alina - ASOS Customer Service representative abruptly and rudely ended the chat because she couldn't help instead of referring the issue to a manager or someone that could have competently dealt with it. All that needed to be done is recognise that the wrong item was refunded against the wrong order number. How do you expect customers to come back when you hire customer service agents that don't understand their role to the general public? One of them is solving the issue and ensuring the customer is satisfied. POOR SERVICE ALL AROUND. Will not shop here again.

            I've been shopping with Asos for some years now, never had any issues before as I got what I ordered, got refunded for what I returned, etc. All was well. Recently however I had to deal with Asos customer service which is by far the worst I've ever dealt with online in the past 12+ years. If you have any other than general question, you're out of luck. You won't get any help from anyone, not via chat, emails, anything, you'll only get their general policies repeated until you give up. It's my most tiresome and insane experience with a shop, ever. Online or off. Long story:1. I order 2 items.2. The items arrive, I ask a question about the design via Asos Chat and I'm told I'd be getting contacted via email within the next 48 hours.3. I send back the 2 items.4. I get no answer to my question but instead, I get a shipping confirmation email. I log on to Asos and notice I've been shipped another one for no reason. I didn't order it, I didn't ask for it, someone just didn't read my question and sent me a new item. Even though in my original question about the design, I specified that I do not want this item.5. I contact Asos via chat about the order I didn't make, I'm told I won't be charged for this as I didn't place this order and will be refunded for the return shipping too (10.80€ from my country).6. I send back the unordered item. I ask Asos via chat if I could maybe get a replacement. I'm told Asos doesn't do replacements internationally, even though one had already been made without my consent that I had mentioned in this same chat.7. I get a refund for 1 item of the original order even though I returned 2. I contact Asos as I suspect my money's being held until the replacement is with Asos, too, and I'm told I should wait for 24 hours. I wait 24 hours, contact Asos, I'm told to wait another 24 hours. Turns out Asos is holding on to my money until the replacement is returned as expected, making me pay for the replacement after the fact.8. I contact Asos a via chat, always get different answers with employees now starting to get rude towards me and/or not reading or understanding my issue, eventually cutting me off.9. Asos' carrier is taking more time than before, not updating the unordered return package info at all .Other returns have been with Asos within a week with daily email updates and I've gotten my refund within a week from that. Now the package has been with Asos carrier for almost 3 weeks with a single update. Local post office records show it left the country 2 weeks ago.10. I contacted Asos carrier, reBOUND returns and was told the parcel is delayed due to adverse weather and assuring me the package is with the carrier. Been over a week since I contacted reBOUND returns, still no updates.In short, Asos made a mistake by not reading my original question. Instead they ignored it, started this mess by sending me something I didn't want that now their carrier apparently lost or something and Asos will just hold on to my money? Asos made a mistake and I pay for it.If it's a simple cheap order, feel free to place it. If you think there'll be any issues, you won't get any help. No one at Asos will hear you or treat you like a valued customer.

            I was using their services for 7+ years, but recently the company has turned into complete crap. I see a lot of issues with their delivery... same happened to me multiple times. Whenever you are using any promo codes or vouchers, please, guys, everyone, read T&Cs very carefully. Their customer service staff are only polite when you have general enquiry, if you need more serious in depth answers they just do not respond to your questions on the chat.*Generally, look at how many items are out of stock?! Ridiculous.*Hardly anything new and interesting was added to the site lately.*They have faulty products with 10% discount. Come on, ASOS, if one customer sends the item back because there is a faulty, I do not think it is such a great idea to keep on displaying this item for the same price (for the next 3+ months...) and wait until some other guy buys it. *Look how outdated some of the things are! They keep on selling last and before last season items full price. Honestly, the only thing that is alright about them is Klarna. But do you need it when your items get lost or you cannot get a full refund? They even ended ASOS A-LIST! What are the incentives for shopping with them?

            I don't understand how asos can get a bad review... I love asos! I've been ordering anything from clothes, to shoes, home decor and jewllery. The descriptions are thorough, you can see the product on the model in a video, you can zoom in the pics. Delivery doesn't take longer than a week and even if there's ever something wrong with your order - which happened to me twice in the past 7 years - they are extremely helpful. They do both refunds and replacements. Personally, I couldn't be happier with this retailer!

            I am from Singapore and I have an asos package that should arrive on 26th October. I contacted them only on 2nd November when it still hasn't arrived - I WAITED AN ENTIRE WEEK ALREADY. Firstly, I waited for an hour and I still could not get on the live chats. I gave up and waited few hours later before trying again. Secondly, the customer service is slow and unhelpful. They do not provide me with any information that I actually need, all they do is tell me to wait till 5th November ""before they can help me further"". I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY CANT THEY HELP ME NOW? I ALREADY WAITED AN ENTIRE WEEK. Thirdly, ASOS stop working with my local postage service and this is the biggest problem --> there is NO tracking number provided and ASOS customer service do not know what the new courier is. I asked 2 of them MULTIPLE times and they just can't answer it. They just keep asking me to check with my local postage service when they do not even work w ASOS anymore. This isn't the first time I have problems ordering from asos. They have good quality and nice items. But order at your own risk, your parcel may not arrive at the date ASOS promised and they will do nothing about it but tell you to wait and just leaving the chat (if u can even get on one).

            the second issue i had occurred when i placed an order that was lost by the carrier. the tracking notified me that the package was set to be delivered to me 2 days before my delivery date that ASOS advised. however, the carrier lost the package. when i contacted ASOS they told me that i still had to wait until it was THEIR delivery date before they would do anything about the issue. the customer service rep who was chatting with was completely rude and told me that i still needed to wait, even after i told her that the package was lost by the carrier so the point of having to wait seemed worthless. you would think that when a customers' package is lost they would just reship the item and cancel the lost the one but no. they are very dismissive and very unhelpful.

            If I could have given no stars I would. Never used them before this order and will never use again. Ordered two items on Monday and was advised delivery would be on the Thursday or before. This is when it started to go downhill. In the Wednesday I am told one item they cannot fulfil and have refunded my monies which could take two weeks!!!Thursday comes and the other item doesn’t turn up and Asos customer service don’t care, simply blame it on the delivery company Hermes. Will not be using this company ever again.

            We buy from Asos few times a year, till now everything was perfect, they have very good stuff,  also some stuff that you cant buy in normal stores-limited edition clothes and shoes.

            I use to REALLY enjoy shopping here, this past order has been by far the absolute worse experince I have EVER experienced while shopping. I order one coat a single item around the very beginning of the month, it was expected to arrive around the 28th which was fine. I bought the item because I was going out of town and had no coat and was leaving the 1st of the following month. Well the expected date arives and behold no package. I contacted customer support and this is when it took a turn for the worst. They argued over and over for almost 20 minutes until finally saying we needed a extra day for shipping it will be there the 30th. Two days pass and still no package so I contact them again. And the proceed to continue to tell me oh the date of arival was changed now to the 31st. At this point I was frustrated and anxious since I was going to a new city with out a coat because I was relying on them. And asked the customer care lady “it will ABSOLUTELY be here tomorrow right? No matter what you are tracking it and it will be here” and she told me yes. So the 31st comes usps has been to my house already and no package.  I contact ASOS again and they tell me the same thing “wait till the end of the day it will be there by today” I explained usps has already been to my house and they proceeded to tell me to wait it will be there today and ended the chat on me before finishing the conversation. Here comes the big issue. Of course it didn’t arrive it’s now the 1st of next month I went out and bought something new in place of the jacket I planned to have. That morning I recived a email stating that my package JUST SHIPPED ALMOST 3 WEEKS LATER. I tried contacting customer support again. Not just about the package being gone, but now for the terrible customer support. He argued back and fourth for awhile he told me “it’s now expected Nov. 06 wait until the end of the day, if it’s not there by Nov. 09 then we can look into it” although he acknowledged that it’s incredibly late. And offered me 4.99 back on the product and said look at our website for promo discounts in exchange for the bad customer support. I asked to speak to a supervisor or anyone able to help me since clearly this situation was above his capability but he refused and just like the last lady I spoke to closed the chat before meeting a resolution. Long story short WORST place to buy anything

            I really would not recommend to order from Asos.com. Their customer service is the worst of any I have encountered. I have ordered a big order and after few days I received an e-mail that my order is delivered. BUT it was it TOTALLY DIFFERENT CITY. After double checking address which i wrote down in order, confirmation letters from ASOS and contacting delivery company I realized that it was ASOS mistake. After that I contacted ASOS with all evidence, that it was their mistake.  We had a long conversation, but after all evidence and my honest request for help they did not admitted, that it was even a mistake! They offered me to go pick a package by myself from totally different town (which would cost me my time and money to get there). Or just wait, at least 10 days, for the package to be sent back to them and get my money back after at least another 14 days and if I still will want the goods to order it again (if it still will be available). So if you value your time, money and nerves don't order from ASOS.com

            Hello, Could you believe it?I would not recommend to order from this E-shop now days... Their customer service seems to be trolling and messing around with its customers. I have ordered for more than 200$, at 14-10-2018. I have received an e-mail that the order is going to be delivered at 18-10-2018 [as it should]. But I have noticed, that the package is in totally different city [120km away]. I have contacted ASOS if they could fix this and WOW did not expect that coming.They have said that they can not do anything and they are sure it is not their fault, then they directed me to the delivery company. I have contacted them - they actually have sent me all the documentation that they have received from ASOS, with exact proof of ASOS sending the order to wrong post adress. [instead of 9000 post code --> 8900]. I have attached all this information and re-send to ASOS. Nor they have offered any viable solution, nor they have admitted their mistake and offered to wait for 10 days, for the package to be sent back to them. And then the refund process would be done within 10 days, by me paying the ""delivery cost""... And I just wanted to receive the goods by spotting their obvious mistake. [since I do not like conflicts I used my own money to get to the town to pick up the package...] Moral --> if you do not have a car, think twice before ordering from these rednecks. Good luck!

            I bought premium delivery from ASOS and purchased a two pairs of chinos. DPD (ASOS courier) then delivered my parcel to my billing address instead of my delivery address. DPD refuses to amend the addresss and advisers they could deliver to a shop. ASOS said I could purchase another set and be refunded for the first set once they had recieved them back from DPD.ASOS refuses to send a new set out at their expense awaiting the pair to be returned by their incompetent courier. In my advice do not use either of these companies as their customer service is non-exaistant. A simple fix would have been to:A) send the item to the correct address to start B) send it to the correct address when I had told me they had sent to the wrong one.C) send me a new set at your expense (not mine) and receive back your parcel from your incompetent courier.

            One star because I can’t leave zero stars. ASOS customer service is appalling. They might as well not offer a customer service. Used them multiple times regarding faulty products and  products which don’t even arrive. Each time I have been met by a very rude, aggressive, almost bullying tone, from “customer service providers” who seem very angry and unhappy and can offer no help whatsoever. Got told to take my faulty, ripped dress (which I had bought for a wedding) to a clothing repair shop at my own expense! On another occasion when my item didn’t arrive (I had paid extra for next day delivery as I needed it) I was told to keep waiting and come back another day. Not good enough. Shocking service.

            NEVER place your order unless you got  a promo code!  Please DO read the customer reviews before purchasing!I placed my first order yesterday without getting a welcome discount for a new customer as most shopping websites usually offer 10% off on the first order.Today, I just found that they offer 15% off on everything. So I asked for a price adjustment or giving me a promo code for my next purchase but they refused, and then I tried to cancel my order but the cancellation has be done within one hour after placing an order.I have not received any of the items from ASOS. Hopefully, the quality of products is good enough for me to ignore their unsteady pricing and unacceptable policy.Michelle from Canada10/29/2018

            Placed an order online for some clothes for a holiday leaving this week. I have one address on my account which is my current address. For some reason ASOS have decided to send my clothes to an old address over 100 miles from my current address and will not do anything to help.I noticed as soon as the confirmation email came through but had no option to cancel. I went on live chat and the theme of dreadful customer service continued with my live chat representative just leaving the chat. The error is at ASOS but I am being punished. I will never use this company again.

            Seems to be a recurring issue - I too have ASOS Premier and pay for next day delivery but again, what should have been delivered the next day did not arrive and now have to wait 4 days for a response from DPD - according to ASOS Customer Services, they are following 'regulations' but neglected to explain to me what these 'regulations' were.

            Never had any issues, until my parcel was not delivered the following day as expected (I have paid £9.95 for premier delivery). Informed I needed to wait an additional 4 days for it to be delivered, which it wasn’t. Requested a refund which was provided, but no explanation was given at all. Then to my horror the exact same thing happened again exactly a week later. Contacted ASOS after 10pm and was told to send another email if parcel is not delivered by 12am!!!! On the first occasion I was informed these things happen occasionally, but two times in the space of a week.  My biggest issue is the scripted responses from Customer Service, with no explanation as to why this has happened or what they plan to do.  Neither do ther offer any form of goodwill gesture for the inconvenience caused to their customers.I have never had issues with ASOS previously, but it seems the company is no longer reliable so I will not be shopping on the site anymore.

            Ordered 4 items from them a few weeks ago and they sent me the wrong size for some trousers. I sent them back for an exchange the next day and forgot I even sent them until about 6 days later as I had not even received an email to say they had received them. I spoke to someone on chat and they said they had received it but advised me to wait another day as it was 7 working days processing time for a refund/exchange. I waited another 4 working days and still had not heard anything. I messaged them again yesterday and they said this has been escalated to another team and would once again take another 24hrs. I’m under the impression they had lost the trousers I had returned or someone in their warehouse messed up. At this point I was fuming and I wasn’t given any explanation, just told to wait, wait, wait. Once again I messaged them noon 24hrs later and explained the situation a third time. The girl I was speaking to said no one got back to me as there had been “tech issues” but she still could not tell me where/what had happened to my return. Once again told to wait longer and she can’t do anything. I waited a few more hours and still nothing. Then I chatted with the worst customer service employee I’ve ever had to deal with, George. He didn’t care and once again I had to explain myself. He said I had to wait until the end of the day. As it was Sunday, I asked when as I didn’t know they worked 24hrs. I got a condescending reply that the end of the day means midnight as if I was a fool. I told him if I didn’t get an email by then I would charge it back on my card as this was getting ridiculous now. As I was chatting with him I send the chat log to my email to keep a record of it and closed the chat. A few minutes later I recieved an email with the chat log and after I closed the chat he replied with “ ok, no problem. If that’s all then close the chat”. There was no apology no nothing. Just a juvenile response from a sad childish person. Midnight came and no email. Before I callled my card company I gave them one more chance. I explained the situation again and was told by the girl that I would be getting an exchange and not a refund and that the order will be with me tomrrow, 30mins later I receive an email saying my order will be with me in 2 days, there’s no tracking information or anything and I won’t even be at home to receive it as I’ll be at work on that day. I’ve received no email before then and now I’ll be unable to receive the trousers that I’ve paid for almost 3 weeks ago now as I’ll be at work and all this because of their mistake/lack of communication. After spending £600 this month on ASOS I don’t think I’ll be spending my money there again.

            Useless. In breach of contract and say they can't do anything for another 3 days. They're already 2 days late - you'd think they would want to do something about that but apparently they don't care. Meanwhile, over £400 of my belongings are sat somewhere in Wembley according to my tracking information with no explanation! So either ASOS think it's ok for couriers to steal people's orders, or they think it's ok for couriers to do whatever they like with your stuff for 4-5 days before they actually give you your order! Either one...ridiculous!

            I bought a £30 voucher from ASOS on line for my daughter in law's birthday; I received an email thanking me for my purchase and telling me I would receive another email with the code she would need to use to redeem it and I assume some kind of voucher to print out and put in her birthday card. This email never arrived so I went on to the ASOS website and used their so called 'customer care'  area and sent them an email explaining the problem. I called them a few days later and I have now received the email with the code, a little late for the birthday.

I will never purchase from them again and also I told my other friends that were ordering from them and they stopped as well . Purely unacceptable !

            I have just had the most horrific experience with Asos.  I made an order of 9 items last week and out of 9 items today I received 6 so 3 of the items were missing.I contacted customer service and as usual found a rude person where I was offered no apology and was told that I have to wait another 24 hours for them to get in touch with me about my missing items, items which I have already paid for!!When I told the person (someone with the name of Redmond) on the chat service that this was unacceptable he simply dismissed my comment and told me if that was all I was free to close the chat.  How condescending to say the least.  When I opened one of the dresses that I had ordered, not only is it different to the picture I saw online but it was packed with the zipper fully open on the back of the dress and sent to me in a state which seemed that someone had just tried it on and stuffed it back in the plastic bag it came in.  They never even bothered to repack it neatly before sending it to another buyer which to me now looks very obvious that it has already been worn.What a horrible service.  Never again Asos, never again!!

            Terrible customer service and overall just disappointed in ASOS leadership. As several others have stated, their customer service team does not care at all about your experience, they are short and indifferent. I had an order that was supposed to come on or before the 22nd, when I reached out the next day to inquire about the missing order they told me it may arrive on or before the 31st, I explained how frustrating this is as that is 10+ days delayed and they said, ""out of our control"", when I asked if I could speak to their manager, a woman named Ama said, ""we are all one big team, there is not manager"" (this was definitely a copy and paste job) and then she terminated the chat without asking me if there was anything else she could do, I reopened my chat with someone named Matt to let him know that, first off - I know this isn't directly their fault, that I respect them and would like to be treated with respect in return, I told him I was upset that Ama hung up on me and I asked him if his organization believes this is an OK way to treat their customers, he gave me an indirect response saying Ama was right that there's nothing they can do and that if she feels there's nothing more to add she can terminate the chat...I told him I hope he's proud of that decision. It is honestly sad because I advise organizations for a living and I know the people in customer support are probably treated terribly and hate their jobs. As rude as they were, I don't blame them I blame the executives who don't make them a priority or instill respect as one of their core values. Very disappointed in ASOS.

            Honestly have not been treated as badly by any other store than what I have by ASOS I used to be a loyal customer who ordered from their website weekly then noticed my ASOS VIP perks and vouchers had stopped, so contacted their customer services who had told me due to the GDPR legislation I had to click the link in an email they sent me which I actually hadn't received, ok was passed through to another colleague who had pretty much insinuated I was lying and was being quite defensive to me saying"" I was sent this email it's been all over social media "" - if this had been all over social media I would of known about it right and not had to contact them? Wrong, they then went onto say it would not be honoured to me, and quite frankly after the really rude customer service I received I said ok, you have now lost a loyal customer

            The worst experience I have ever had, shopping online!I'm a Danish citizen, currently located in Russian for study.I bought some brown boat shoes, and receiving them was not a problem, infact I had no problems getting them. But the shoes were too small, and I have to send them back. Usually there are free returns from Russian using Boxberry, but Boxberry is a Russian company, and to return a package, I have to upload my passport on their website for confirmation purposes. But the problem is that, they only accept passports from slavic countries! Leaving me in the worst nightmare ever.I have been contacting alot of people on ASOS' chat, seeking help. Firstly I spoke with a person named Connor, telling me to try call Boxberry, and he sent the case to their Russian department, so I received a mail later. Really no help!Then I tried to get help from two Russian friends (both native!) I went to the physical boxberry post-office, and have been calling them by phone. I even tried filling out the boxberry website form, using my friends' passports. Still no luck!When I contact ASOS again, I get to speak with a person named Rhys, which were really Rude, and I told how fustrating this situation was.And I was once again refered to the Russian team, but I told Rhys, that I had already been in contact with them, and it didn't help, and I further asked if there was something else that could be done.Rhys replied, no... and if I didn't have anything else to say, I should just close the window!I still haven't sent the package, and the 28 days (the frame for sending back the package) are almost up. It feels like a business strategy from ASOS' side. It looks good on the website with all this ""FREE RETURNS"" and what ever, but when you need it, it's not gonna be easy.Just to warn people, never buy clothes from ASOS, if you are located in Russia, and don't have russian citizenship. Because ASOS won't help you!

            Hands down the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ordered online and returned a pair of pants that had a rip in them. I received $0 in return as they said returning those pants voided the sale code used when the purchase was madeand that because of that i was no due any refund amount. So they now have the pants and my $$$. They also refused to replace them.

Queried it with ASOS customer service team and was told ""Theres nothing we can do"", I naturally protested and was told ""We'll ask DPD and let you know""They didn't let me know so I've had to chase this up myself.  I've been on live chat twice in 20 minutes and received rude, unhelpful customer service. I was told again ""We'll look into it with DPD and let you know"".I'll wait the standard 2-5 days as advised but don't hold much hope for an answer (or refund)On both occasions the advisors closed the live chat windows without resolving the issue, showing compassion or understanding, very disappointing.Unreliable service and extremely poor customer service, won't be shopping there again.

            Finally gave in and ordered a gorgeous dress i had been wanting for months. I payed next day delivery so id have it just in time for a wedding that week. However, when the product arrived I was left very disappointed. ASOS had shipped me out a faulty item with a large rip in it. I Complained to the customer service and they told me they couldn’t do anything about it. Instead, I’d have to send it back and get a refund. However, I was not to be refunded for the next day delivery which was rather annoying considering it was because of the fault that it had to be sent back at all. Although this experience was very bad I have had countless other experiences that have been the complete opposite. This experience will not make me stop shopping at ASOS because they have so many great products, but has made me more reluctant to order.

            Ordered 4 items from ASOS. I received a ""confirmation"" email/text saying it had been delivered. I hadn't received aynything, and the driver had scribbled something in the delivery box. I contacted ASOS however 3 out 4 items were now out of stock. They refunded me for the 3 and sent out a replacement for the 4th. The exact same thing happened with delivery again and I still hadn't received any items. I contacted ASOS again, and a 3rd attempt was made. Luckily I received this one. The first two deliverys were made by HERMES and the 3rd by DPD. I know the blame is on the delivery driver, however these are the people that ASOS choose to represent them and it all falls back on them. Ultimately i've been left with only 1 of 4 items I originally ordered. This was my first time buying from ASOS and it's left me weary from buying from them again. Diasspointed to say the least.

            Asos used to be really fast with the shipping and respond times for the customer service. This has changed drastically over the last year or so.Two of my last orders with Premier Delivery has taken between 5-7 days instead of the 1-2 days it used to take before. It's basically taking longer with Premier Delivery now than what Standard Delivery took 1 year ago.My last order I made 8 days ago with Premier Delivery has still not arrived.

            Just had a similar situation to others on this site.My husband ordered a parcel for next day delivery but it never arrived. Spoke to ASOS customer service who advised it should be with you soon as there was an issue with the courier (not an acceptable excuse as had paid for next day delivery) but by this point my husbands birthday had come and gone so he just thought he would wait. Finally today he got a message to say the parcel had arrived, he went to his local collect plus only to find the package had been opened and all the clothes stolen but only a shoebox had been left inside and resealed. My husband had paid with a credit card so he cancelled the payment straight away and told ASOS. As others have said the “manager” is never available to talk???. Definitely some fraudulent activity going on here and we will be taking it further!

            If I could give no stars I would. Placed two orders for Sunday delivery. One was never despatched even though customer services tried to tell me it had (there was no tracking information available so was clearly a lie). Then order 360858427 was never delivered. Even though DPD have advised it was and a signature was obtained. DPD and Asos have looked into this and confirmed delivery was never made. It’s now three days later and the driver still has the parcel. Asos have advised this isn’t fraud or theft. And are happy with the service they’ve given so won’t be offering a gesture of goodwill. Asos won’t let me speak to a manager as apparently they “can deal with it” even though every single member of staff I’ve spoken with has failed to resolve this. I’m now having to take this to the police and trading standards as I have proof the driver is in possession of the goods, has lied about obtaining signature and Asos won’t refund. Total joke of a company.

            Absolutely terrible service. ASOS are fine except when something goes wrong. When something goes wrong, they do everything they can to wriggle out of resolving the issue and refuse to help you. I have an item due to be delivered before 11th October. To this date, it has still not arrived. It was sent via Hermes. ASOS told me to contact them regarding the missing item. When I did, they tell me they won't help me and to email them back on the 22nd October. I have asked them multiple times to contact their carrier (hermes) in order to trace the item, as the tracking has not updated since October 11th. They told me they cannot get in touch with their courier. I have asked to make a formal complaint, they refused to provide me the information to do so. I asked to escalate my complaint, I was told it would be investigated by a 'specialist care team' and I would be contacted. The 'specialist care team' doesn't exist, and all i got back was an email that was copy and paste the exact same words. This company are a disgrace, and I will be taking this complaint as far as I can take it. At this point they have my money and have not supplied the item, and this is theft.

            I ordered my items a week (working days) before that I need them, and I did get them on time, but of course them sent me the wrong item. I had a talk with one online customer service for the issue and I expect an express delivery since I actually need them by day after tomorrow. And she told me that she cannot give me the express delivery and she will pass on the issue to the specialist team that takes up to 72 hours to respond (and she knows I need all the items by day after tomorrow). Thank you for the great service and making customers to facing such an inconvenient and awkward situation BECAUSE YOU CANT EVEN OFFER AN EXPRESS DELIVERY!!!

            I paid for next day delivery, order never came. They took £160 from my account and denied it. They refused to take ownership and admit they had taken the money. They said their finance team would get back to me, they never did. I had to start a procedure with Visa to get the money back. They never said sorry, never offered compensation. Bunch of crooks.

            If I could have given it a zero I would. Dreadful customer service. Every order I have had problems with. They have sent me incorrect items with the right code on the packaging. I am still waiting for a refund on these itemsI have spent literally hours on their chat lines and they could not care less about customer service. I have yet to receive any help from them and they will not talk to you directly and just end “on line” chat . They refuse to telephone you or refer you to somebody who may help. Deliveries always delayed, items then wrong and they take no responsibility for their agent couriers. Nor will they share details of their courier service with you. I will NEVER purchase from them again and urge the brands they sell to consider the negative impact that ASOS is creating for their brands.

            October 13th Had the nerve to say they couldn't find my order when I sent the lady the order number through the online customer service chat bs!!!! Didn't send a pair of my shoes... Told me she handed it over to the specialist who will email me in 48 hours... I'm not dumb, I know it'll never happen... I'm so upset I want to cry. SCAMMERS. Do yourself a favor & shop else where.UPDATE: October 16thI filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau & the same day the BBB sent my complaint to ASOS, I received an email saying that they sent me a ""replacement"" item. Boom, just like that. It was sent through overnight express shipping & everything. My advice, go above their heads & file a claim... That was totally what helped me 100% because it was just too ironic after being given the run around like every one else... But not too many people take the time to file a claim, if you want your items or money, that's the way to go in my opinion. Not gonna say the issue was resolved until I actually get the item & everything is all good, until then, the claim will still be out against them publicly.

When nothing arrived, I contacted ASOS to be told that my items were out of stock?!?! Funny how I was able to order both and strange that both are now out of stock. When I asked for further answers as to why, I was told there was an issue with my order leaving the warehouse and I would receive my refund in 10-15 working days!!?!? Great so I go away Monday and don’t have money or clothes to go away with. I asked for my complaint to be escalated and was told no. Absolutely shocking!! How are you allowed to treat your customers this way! Totally unacceptable! You’ve had my money for 4 weeks and I’ve had nothing but grief...oh and forgot to add I had to chase my order, we’re ASOS at any point going to notify me. Sort it out ASOS

I am not happy about this not only has it ruined my brothers birthday gift I know have to wait 7 days or more to get my money back for something I have not had / got . I will be taking this further

            Non existent customer care I am so disappointed that I handed over money to this company. I so wished that I had ordered what I needed from Debenhams who had the exact same things. I chose Asos and what a regret. When you are told it is going to be delivered by a certain date you trust in that. I needed these items for the day after delivery. One item was a swimming costume and I wanted to start swimming asap as currently pregnant. When I tell them that I either want the order for the following day or will be forced to return everything as soon as I receive it as I will have to buy the items AGAIN elsewhere!!! But they did not care. The order was due to be delivered 12/10 and they told me they could not do anything until 23rd October. I will not tolerate the fact that this company will not go above and beyond for their customers. They will not rectify mistakes. And they could not care less If you return your items. I will certainly never be ordering from them again.

            Totally will not use this company again.  I ordered an item and for the second day running the courier company Hermes said they tried to deliver and I was not in - the delivery is to my office which is open all day, so they are blatantly lying!  I now have no top to wear to the American football match I am going to this weekend and I have to go through the process of getting my money back.  I am guessing they will throw the item through the open office door next week when I no longer need it.

            I can't say enough good things about ASOS.  Great sale prices, clothes are high quality and fit as described.  And their free shipping and return policy can't be beat.  I never hesitate to buy an item, knowing that if it doesn't fit I won't be out the money spent.

            I went scouring the internet for good plus size clothes that also wouldn't break the bank and came across ASOS. They had a very good assortment so I went ahead and bought five items. I soon get a notification that my order has shipped, but after that, radio silence for about five days and the tracking was showing nothing. Then, the day after the items were supposed to arrive, I receive an e-mail from paypal that I had gotten a partial refund and was confused, because ASOS had said nothing about some of my items being out of stock or anything. So I went to their customer service and chatted with a very helpful employee who quickly told me they had sent my items to the wrong person, and two of the items I had ordered had gone out of stock in the meantime, which sucked. I would have liked the option of choosing another size before they just straight up removed the items, but oh well.The items I received were fine, but naturally the stuff I was most excited about was missing.I don't know if I will order here again, but the customer service was great.

            As a petite girl I shop almost exclusively online for clothes and shoes as most stores don't stock my size in clothing. Forget about size 2 shoes. Trousers are even harder to find because of my hip to waist ratio.I can't recommend ASOS enough. I can order a bunch of clothes to try on that I can pay for in about a months time and if I don't like them I can return them quite easily and they take off the difference from the amount I have to pay. At the end of the day it's almost no different from trying on clothes in a store. First time I ever used them I returned the clothes outside of the 28 days window and they still refunded me. I didn't even have to ask, they just emailed me to acknowledge I've sent them late but they were happy to refund me.I know many people don't feel compelled to leave a review unless they've had a bad experience with a company, which is why I think positive feedback is also important.

            Horrible delivery service. I payed extra to get the delivery at a chosen time slot on a certain day since I needed a pair of shoes for a wedding. The delivery guy went to the wrong door, sending a picture of another number saying I was not in. I called costumer service right away, they told me he could come back to the right door at the end of his shift so I had to stay in waiting that night, which I did. (But what about my job or classes? Hence why I booked that hour slot.)However, he did not show. He came the next day with the wrong order. I had ordered shoes and he gave me a jacket. Now I have no chance of getting the shoes in time for the wedding so I had to myself go to the post office to send back the jacket and ask for my money back. Taking two days of my time which I could have spent finding other shoes.

            My review is a contrast to the other reviews out there. Probably maybe I placed 1 order, which i received within 7 days. That too I live in Dubai and the item estimated delivery date was on or before the 11th. I received it 2 days earlier. The tracking mechanism was spot on and no issues there. Moreover, the product was perfect as ordered + the prices on Asos are a steal. Especially if you compare it with the prices in Dubai here. Almost 50% less. Would highly recommend shopping from Asos. Lets see, I will place a second order and hopefully no mess ups.

            No any support in case of delivery issues. Please find response below:  Hello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for your items.It’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.JonathanASOS

            I used to shop EXCLUSIVELY at ASOS. I loved the large petites selection, and ease of returns. After 3 solid years, and likely thousands of dollars later, I tried to return an order worth around $100. A month later, I still had no return notice or refund. I reached out to their customer service chat. They were so rude and dismissive and told me there was nothing they could do since I used a UPS drop box location, therefore I didn't have a tracking number. Please note that this is what i had ALWAYS done. After taking a few other customer service routes, and receiving the same response, I had to give up and was out $100. UPS also cannot help me since ASOS won't tell me the tracking number that is on the pre-printed label from ASOS. I obviously don't have it since it is on the package. Just a truly appalling experience after so many positive transactions. However, I cannot continue to give me business to them after this.

            Because ASOS is such a big company and has so many influencers promoting them, it’s easy to trust the site. But essentially they’re a scam. The item quality is rarely what’s advertised. So trust me, at least some of the items you’ll want to return. ASOS always advertises their easy return system, but it’s never easy. They don’t keep you updated on the return process so even when it’s returned and processed on their part, you won’t get any notifications or actual refund. And when you reach out to the company, it’s likely they’ll only give you a portion of the refund or none at all. I highly recommend everyone steer clear of this company. All you’ll hear is good from influencers because they’re being sponsored. Listen to the real reviews.

            I paid extra to have my parcel delivered on a day and time to suit me because of work only to receive an email after the time they were supposed to deliver stating that I had rearranged delivery! I contacted customer services who said that the parcel company had tried to deliver to the wrong address and now delivery couldn't be made so had to be rearranged for another day.Total waste of money paying for timed and dated delivery. Customer services were useless no help at all. At first they implied I was lying about being in!!!! Dreadful company.

            I was so excited to find these pants for my sons Freshman hoco. First the delivery was delayed and when i reached out they advised me the package was delayed with the carrier and would be delivered on 10/5 by 8pm- unacceptable since I had to get the pants taken in. Luckily they did come 2 days after the original track date and we were able to wear them without tailoring. HOWEVER on the way to take pictures for homecoming I noticed the back of the pants were completely frayed. They just continued to get worse as the night went on. I’m so disappointed in the quality of these pants for the price I paid. My intention was to send my son to his first homecoming experience feeling and looking classy and instead he was made to feel insecure and cheap. I will never shop here again. I hope come Monday morning when I call they at least offer to refund my money.

            Asos is always my go to shop and I purchase from them on at least a monthly basis! I pay a one off charge for unlimited next day delivery (which I have done for 3 years) and have never once had an issue or delay with my items! On the rare occasion that I have had to return an item the process is always free and refunds are as fast as can be expected. I would recommended to anybody 😌

            I selected next day delivery because I knew I would be in. It was delayed from 1-3pm to 5-7pm and then Hermes stated on there tracker that an attempt was made to deliver it which was not correct at all as there was no attempt in delivering my parcel. ASOS’ customer service team basically said I was lying and that I was not in all day and that they “have to go off the tracking”. Actually I was in all day and had to change my plans when it was first delayed.  I work in retail so I know that the customer is not always right but I’m this case I was.There next response was that there was “delay with our carrier, please allow until the end of the day on 11th October for your order” which is 6 days after expected delivery day !! For a company this size to offer no solution is absolutely shocking and to make out if I was lying is not a company I want to buy from.

            Omg. Why so many negative comments? I order 3-4 times per year from them for almost 3 years now and never had an issue! Only once that i had to question something they answered within a day. Shipping is always on time and some days is faster without choosing express delivery. Quality of clothes vary but the product details and the catwalk videos helps you to understand the quality better. 2-3 times that i had to send something back they refund me immediately they received it. The best is that returns are free. Thank you Asos for the great customer service!

            Disgusting Customer Service!!I have never experiences anything like it! When speaking to them you get the feeling they do not even intend to help you and you get passed on from one useless person to another. After having so many issues of this year with them there is no way I will ever shop at Asos again!- Paid for premium delivery: They took my money, but it has never been activated! Customer Service tells me everyday for the last month they will look into it but NOTHING has happened- my student discount doesn't work anymore for some reason: they tell me to wait until my card expired and I apply for a new one... MY CARD EXPIRES IN 2 YEARS! The customer service at Asos literally ruins the whole shopping experience and therefore I would not recommend anyone to shop there

            I ordered six items and then I get an email saying that 2 of those 6 items were out of stock but they already sent out the other four. I contacted a chat customer service where the employee told me that one of those items actually is in stock but he can't do anything about it because they already sent the other stuff and that I just had to make another order if I wanted it ?? So because of the company's mistake the customer has to order again and pay for another shipment and custom fee? There was nothing he would do to reimburse me in any way. Not even offer a free shipment or discount/giftcard knowing that the customer is loosing money either way because of a mistake that they made.

            Sent me complete different substitute items in the wrong size twice when my order was out of stock to enable them to still take my money. They then denied it happened and claimed it was just a mistake...which conveniently happened twice? Customer care useless and just sent out generic ‘please return this item and we can refund it’ responses. Didn’t actually address the fact I have to be incovienced and out of pocket for at least 10 days because they clearly have a policy of substituting out of stock would items. When I pointed out that I would be £95 out of pocket for at least ten days they suggested using their credit/pay later option to order something else from them!

            Ordered ASOS PETITE Skirted Duffle Coat - Blush / UK 10	65.00QTY: 1 Product Code: 6855769And oh my god, it was used and sent to me! It was creased so much and the horrible fact that a Starbucks receipt from Preston fisher gate! I live two hours away!!!!! It was in the coat pocket when I put it on, made me feel so disgusted, this put me in full inspection mode and as I had another person with me they confirmed it didn’t have that factory or neutral scent that clothings come in. I contacted customer service and all they could say is send it back and you’ll receive a refund. I previously had a faulty item sent to me last year which they resolved but I ended up with a hole in my boots months later. Never the less I gave ASOS another chance but now they’re telling me they’re sorry and they inspect every product before sending it out but on this occasion they let it slip. Like okay, but why am I not getting a proper explanation or other ways to resolve this instead of me sending it back and being out of pocket or without a coat to wear for autumn? I honestly feel that they are trying to get me to send it back so they can put it back on stock( someone will definitely buy it ASAP) so they can send a worn coat to them. I asked for a discount and all they said was they couldn’t do it as I’ve already purchased it. It’s really shocking to me to receive this king of behaviour from a big company! I actually asked them if I could speak to the manager and they said they wasn’t able to get a hold. Avoid and go to a company that actually feels liable if something occurs ! Missguided is the best so I will be sticking to that

Not only that but I can't be refunded my delivery fee, they won't cancel the order, they refuse to contact Doddle about getting it returned back to them so I can be refunded. So I'm out of pocket for clothes I no longer need and they expect me to wait a week for a delivery that may not even happen, and then RETURN to get my money back. Absolutely shocking service, the advisor Sophie was patronising and no help at all, didn't even offer any form of goodwill as I honestly would wait and do that if they just showed some understanding.

            I have been a customer of ASOS for years. They used to be great, but something appears to have happened in the last 6 months. I had one delivery never turn up on the requested date and ASOS tried to blame me, stating I missed the deliver (I did not) - when it did eventually turned up, the carrier told me they never even attempted a delivery on the original date. I informed ASOS of this and they denied all knowledge - even with the back up of the carrier. I am now having another issue with a next day delivery that is over a week late; I keep being fobbed off. Apparently, there is a delay on the delivery, however I was never informed (surely, a basic element of customer service) and when I enquired as to why I was treated rudely. The customer service and delivery has become appalling which is so disappointing.

            The worst customer experience I've ever had. They put me through a nightmare of trying to arrange collections through their partner company, Hermes. This took repeated tries, many conversations with both companies and a huge amount of my time wasted. When I gave up and returned the items using another means, they failed to send me an email confirming the refund for some of the items returned. I was forced to spend time reviewing the entire order, comparing it to the refund emails to check what wasn't refunded. I was about to contact them to find out why £170 of products weren't refunded but luckily spotted the total in my bank statement matched. I'll never shop with ASOS again.

This is probably on of the best retailers out there except for Amazon.I've made dozens of orders, going years back, and they never ever failed me.

            Terrible, robotic customer service and refusal to refund for any reason. I was on a chat with someone thinking I was making progress, only for them to take FIVE MINUTES to type the SAME COMPUTER GENERATED RESPONSE I was getting over email from every single employee there. It's like they don't even read your responses - they just see the word ""refund"" and ""no proof of posting"" and then copy + paste their generic, unhelpful responses back to you.They just started requiring ""proof of posting"" - I have never, ever been asked for this before, until the last 2 months. Now, they REFUSE, NO MATTER WHAT to give a refund or store credit for any orders not received. In fact, store credit is not even an option. Apparently YOU are responsible for what the USPS does with your package until ASOS receives it. They WILL NOT give you the benefit of the doubt, EVER. You are just a number to them. You can email and chat with all the people wherever they are at, and they will all give you the same. exact. answer. They will not respond with emotion, or sympathy, or anything, EVER. I would say I am never going to order from them again, but that's a lie. They have cute clothes at prices I can afford as a lower income person in an expensive cost of living area. So, what my plan is going forward is to ALWAYS OBTAIN PROOF OF MAILING THE ITEM BACK. I will even pay for it if I have to. I don't care, as long as I can prove to these thieves that I returned my items. I am not a thief, I've never stolen from ASOS and pretended to return something when I didn't. Even though they prefer to consider all customers as thieves, I am still going to order from them. And how will I protect myself? I am going to do exactly what they asked, prove to them I returned my items, and FORCE them to refund me next time this happens. If they play games like this again when I DO have proof, then I may consider finding other places to shop.Buyer beware. Be sure to follow the instructions of obtaining proof you made a return!

Checked with the neighbour again and they confirmed the same ‘never got it’.At this point, I did not knew what to do and advised Asos to have it collected from the same place wherever the driver has left it. Hence, I thought everything would be resolved by now, but this morning recieved an email from ASOS, “My name is Isobel, I'm one of the supervisors here working alongside Paul.  He's not in over the weekends, so this has been passed to myself.  Thanks for getting in touch, I hope you're well!I've just been in touch with DPD and they have advised me that they have a signature match for someone with that name at number 20 from a couple of previous deliveries.  As such, they have deemed this correctly delivered and we'll no longer be able to take this any further.  From this point on, this would be a civil matter between yourselves and your neighbours.  I appreciate this isn't the answer you were looking for, and for that I do apologise.If there's anything else I can do for you, let me know and I'd love to help.Best Wishes,IsobelASOS Customer Care”I do not understand if the neighbours are claiming they have not recieved it then, how can ASOS ask their customer to enquire something without evidence. The signature they are claiming has not been shared with me yet. I just want my refund back as I never recieved the order I have placed them, is that too much too ask? If the driver delivers in the wrong place and cannot locate them, is that the customer problem. I feel like a Ping Pong ball chasing with neighbour 17, 20, DPD anf Asos with no results. Disgusting really.

            Order was dispatched 25th September and was to be delivered on or before 27th September but no order received. Contacted on twitter for my younger brother as this is the first thing he has ever ordered and didn’t know what to do, was told due to GDPR he had to contact them. He contacted them on Facebook as on their website but had no reply. Today, he contacted through live chat and was told the same GDPR line that the account holder had to contact? He was logged into his ASOS account so how was he not the account holder? Then asked for his address and said he needs to wait until 9th October for his order and if not received by then, then we can contact again?? How is he expected to wait two weeks for a delivery that was meant to be delivered two days after dispatch? He asked for a refund as he hasn’t received the order and isn’t waiting two weeks but he was refused and told he has to wait until 9th October to go any further. If the order isn’t delivered on the 9th October either then will he have to wait another two weeks? Found the “help” appalling, they clearly do not  want to help their customers and just want their money. I would avoid ordering from this company as they try to avoid even speaking with you and in the middle of a conversation the chat was ended by the operator!! No further forward and the money still taken but no order to show for it.

            I have placed about 10 orders on ASOS. Everything has been well so far. Got plenty of clothes from them and some new favourite personal brands. Delivery is fast, at 7 days. Customer service is very good, never had any issues with them, have had them do anything possible within their powers.Photos can be missleading especially when coming to lighting, products may seem couple colours more vibrant or colorful, than they actually are. Returns proccess is simple and all returns have been accepted, but it is a lenghty proccess, I myself take two weeks into account. When ordering next day delivery, take into account that it takes them about a day to dispatch an order.The products I have kept satisfy me and I still use them on a daily basis.Can't complain.

            I Had a Perfect Experience With Them!This whole review might sound like it was typed by someone who works at ASOS, but I promise I don't. This review is written for the people like me who had bought from them and then went and read all the nasty reviews. I was scared I had wasted my money, and that the sweater I had ordered wouldn't arrive by the time I needed it. Thanks to all these negative reviews, I had been wrecked with fear. However, here's how things went down with me.I had ordered a sweater for a costume, and thought that it was perfect when looking at the pictures. I had researched some reviewers and heard great things about them. So, I went ahead and bought it. Then, afterwards, out of curiosity, I searched up some more reviews. As I have stated before, none of these reviews were accurate for my experience. What ended up happening was that the sweater had arrived a day earlier, which was perfect to show my friends and family that day. Not only that, but the color was even better than what some of the videos on the website had shown. The fabric was knitted and soft, and didn't feel itchy at all. It kept me warm over another t-shirt, but I did wear it without. It was worth my money, and shocked me with how great it was from all the fear I had.If anyone is scared from reading these reviews, or even are thinking about not buying from them, do not listen unless the circumstances of some negative reviews match your's exactly. I would definitely recommend this store and their products, and they shipped from the UK to me in the US and arrived a day EARLY! Perfect experience, good day everyone!

            The promotions are garbage when it comes to returns. If you qualify for $100 off, but then make returns bringing you down to qualifying for $50-75 off, they will not honor a portion of the original discount and instead will take back the entire $100 off! As opposed to giving you the $50-75 off you qualified for. It’s a scam for sure as they expect you to read their lenghthy terms to know this. In addition, they do not print the cost of the item on the sales slip that comes with your order so you have to check the website and get out your calculator to try to make sure you don’t return items causing you to fall below the discount threshhold. After spending thousands on ASOS, I am moving onto shopping exclusively at higher end retailers that are far more accommodating/fair in their customer service/promotions.. I guess you get what you pay for with Asos.

            I would give them 0 stars if I could. I got a lovely email back saying that because I didn't receive 7 of the 8 items I had ordered, I would not be issued a refund and am no longer able to order from ASOS again. As if to say, they don't believe me and instead accused me of theft. SALTY, SALTY professionalism there. I had ordered from ASOS for years and had never had anything like this happen before.

            Recently I ordered many items to try on for a wedding. Sadly none of them were right. It cost a lot of money to try these clothes on as had to pay first. My refunds however took less time than normal. So I am grateful for that. However the quality of the items has deteriorated massively. One item had been tried on by someone with the worst b.o. problem in the world and had not been refreshed. I felt violated trying that item on!  I then order two more items in that week only to receive a wrong item. Had to purchase another to get for next day delivery. Two days ago I placed another order for next day delivery only to receive an email to say it would take two days for the parcel to arrive. The only communication I have received was yesterday saying it would arrive between 6 am and 10pm tonight. This is never the way Asos send out their parcels to premier customers. What is going wrong. Substandard merchandise. Wrong orders and sloppy delivery!???  Something is not right here and customer services barely respond to a complaint now

            ASOS can have some the most unique clothes, accessories and shoes online. And the prices are pretty competitive for the quality. That’s why I gave them a 2 out of 5. However, this comes at a price. Since it’s fast fashion I can only imagine the ppl who pick your clothes and send it off to be shipped to be overwhelmed and flustered. The last two times I ordered from them I was sent the wrong item. I was lucky enough that my correct items were both back in stock and they made it up to me by paying for the shipping, duties and taxes, returned incorrect item and the amount I paid for my original item was refunded to me in full. So that was nice. But I literally had to demand to be sent all of my intellectual property and my account to be closed permanently. After reading online that the customer service on the chat and the ones who email you back are bots and not humans I felt this was the only way. On my second last order with ASOS I returned an incorrect sweater and added a pair of jeans that didn’t fit to the return shipment. I was refunded exactly 8 months later. They have a serious logistics issue. I feel as though a 2 star rating is more than fair and I will not be shopping with them ever again. It’s seems the more popularity they gain the more they find ways to cut costs. But with all that said once you do get through to a real human they are compassionate and understanding and they really do try to make it up to you to the best of their ability. Siobhan and Charlotte were great (especially because they were humans with real emotions). Now I skim through their website and find new sites to shop on but never ASOS.

            When ASOS BASICALLY CALL YOU A LIAR AND SEND YOU THIS EMAIL AND THEN BLOCK ME FROM BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN Hello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for your item.It’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.Best Wishes,

            Asos are a huge company and I have never had a problem with their delivery service and quality of goods. So I have never had to deal with customer service. What I can say is considering the size and volume they deal with the logistics must be astonishing. Also worth pointing out after reading some of the reviews here is that ASOS are not the couriers other companies are. ASOS like many other companies rely on these third party delivery services to get their goods delivered. After many years in business I can tell you that deliveries go wrong with all courier companies. In these cases we should blame the 'messenger' (The Carrier) and perhaps not the supplier.

            Disgusting service. I’ve been a frequent customer of theirs for years and have used their premier service since it has started. Recently had an issue with a delivery item that I am paying next day delivery for to be told that it would be delivered three days later than it was supposed to. When contacting ASOS about the undelivered parcel the advisor was very dismissive and passed it off as not being their problem and the couriers problem. When I explained that i’m paying for a service that i’m not receiving the advisor was quite rude and offered no help or gesture of goodwill to compensate for the inconvenience caused. I’m very disappointed in the service when I have been a very happy customer throughout the years and will now be taking my money elsewhere. Very poorly trained staff and a rude attitude to customers paying for services that are not being upheld.

            Some of the own brand products are lacking in quality but have been a customer for years now and never been let down.  Delivery is always on time and accurate and returns very easy.  Only had a couple of ""incidents"" but both resolved well: 1. Once I returned two items but only one was registered as returned.  After using the ASOS chat function, the second item was also refunded.  2. One item of clothing shrunk significantly after washing in accordance with instructions so I arranged a refund with ASOS easily.

            Terrible delivery service.I have probably paid for next day delivery the past 4 times I have ordered and every single time although it says to expect my order on the date of the next day. It never arrives. Waste of money. And the customer service chat directs me to the tracker which I can see anyway.

            I can't believe how much this company has changed over the last year or so, maybe even 6 months. I've shopped with them for over 10 years, have been a VIP level customer, have paid for premier delivery etc.Their customer service is truly abysmal - I've had repeated issues this year with parcel delivery (completely pointless me paying for next day) and every time they've been as helpful as a chocolate hammer. When offering to replace a faulty item, they said it would take 3 days to deliver - I pointed out that I could order it myself and supposedly receive it the next day! The biggest disappointment has been their resetting of A list levels and points following GDPR. As someone who works in technical product management, and has also had to handle GDPR, I am telling you it was absolutely not necessary for them to delete your levels and points. I can't understand why they've made the decision to do that. They still have your order history, they can still see what level you qualify for based on your last year of purchasing history. It's an absolute sham. It resulting in me losing my level and points, and subsequently not getting a birthday discount code (a small thing, but actually a really negative experience for me as I was anticipating it and saving items to get for my birthday!)ASOS no longer puts the customer first or seems to care about level of care and making customers feel valued. Every complaint I've had has been met with a virtual shrug, no useful help, and the occasional sad 'please accept a 10% discount code' - which is another chocolate hammer, as I already get 10% off all purchases with my NUS.

            During checkout their website glitched and reloaded resulting in me being charged twice for my order and despite sending screen shots of my bank showing the two debits a minute apart, the 2 paypal transactions with different IDs for the same items and correspondence from both my bank and paypal asos spent three days denying and arguing with me about the fact they charged me twice, would not take my concerns seriously and were honestly the worst company ive ever had to deal with. Now they have finally admitted that they were wrong and have ""cancelled the order"" however my bank is still holding my money until asos emails them to say that the money wont be taken... asos says ""Sorry we cant contact your bank"" You are a huge multi nation company and you don't have a single person who can send a basic email so i can get my money returned to me. This means my money wont be released back to me for up to a month and i have debits that will now default and cost me dishonor fees. There is no concern for customer satisfaction whatsoever and i wont ever buy from them again.

            Order regularly for Asos over the past couple of years and I have never had an issue until recently. However this issue is absolutely rediculous. I ordered products due on the 1st of this month (not a small order), via next day delivery (premium membership). They didn't arive which was dissappointing.. However, the issue only arises when it comes to chasing whats happening in regards to a refund on products that appear to be lost and nobody knows where they are! As informed by their customer care team the will have recived the products on the 18th, as goods are automatically returned to them from where ever after not being collected 7 days. 10 days for the returns to be ""processed and refund to be issued"" (their words). It's the 19th today I still yet have to hear anything from the company but ""wait for our specialist team to look into this, we will email"" I'm fed up of lack of communication. Why am I waiting on a refund for products that have/are seemingly never going to be in my possession? Besides this experience; this company has been fine. Probably because I haven't had to communicate with the aftersales or customer care.

            I chasing an order of over £500 for TWO MONTHS. I never received the items, but they eventually refunded after I logged a reversal request with my credit card company. For two months I contacted ASOS over and over and over, and they refused to help or escalate it or give me updates,  and just said useless, vague things. They eventually offered me a gift voucher for £15, which doesn't even cover the money I lost in insurance on the credit card on the payment for the items I never received. I still haven't had an explanation of what went so wrong in this particular case.

            I order a dress from Asos exactly one week ago, they said I  supposed to receive it at 14th of September. I receive a package at 13th of September, which was apparently not mine. I send it back to them, like I am supposed to do. BUT today is 18th and I still doesn't have my dress. I tried to contact them, but because I am living in Austria and they have hotline chat only for german customers, I wasn't received any information or help. I paid them, I want my money back but I am not a german customer. So funny now I don't have dress for my Wedding and money. Thanks Asos for the wonderful experience I will never visit you ever again.

Firstly, my order has been shipped on 11 Sept 2018, then system estimated I will receive my parcel on 1st October 2018. But guess what, I received my parcel after 1 week (18 Sept 2018). After saw so many negative review from other customer, I am happy because my parcel has safely arrived my place (Malaysia) and my clothes are fit to my shape.

            This is my second review. I had to work for my order two weekends in a row because ASOS customer ‘care’ team wouldn’t. Had to pick up phone and call DPD who helped me track my delivery. Had to ask them if I could come and collect the parcel myself. Item was for the wedding and I really had no time to wait. Even though all my issues were related to bad driver behavior and DPD said they gonna investigate this, the impression I got when contacting ASOS customer service was that it’s my fault that I liked the item so I now need to accept my struggles if I want to get it ! The emails I received were extremely immature saying that their service is usually at a very high standards and this is just a one-off case. I had to send them this link showing other 5000 customer reviews and also the image of my Sunday’s pick up location showcasing what their ‘free’ delivery actually means. The chat is completely useless, what they tell you is what you can read yourself on DPD tracking information so maybe if you have reading issues this might be helpful. Your delivery might also get further delayed  (you had the courage to contact them, how dare you?) ! When I figured out the number to call ASOS directly someone was laughing in the background. When asked to speak to a manager, you will get the answer that all of their staff members are trained equally. You might get a call back from supervisor, offering you a 15% discount on full priced items naively thinking you’d like to order from them again. Honestly, if I move out from London it would probably be ASOS fault.P.S. you can see I never left any negative comment on this platform before ASOS came to serve meThis is an update. ASOS contacted me and resolved the issue in a professional way.

I order with you for the next day.ASOS[08:07:06] I completely understand, premier is a one-off payment for the year of £9.95, our next day delivery for one order is £5.95. Just by using a premier more than twice will be beneficial for anyone, I still understand the frustration. These delays are out of our control as we're going through a busy period at the moment.beth [08:10:46] thats not acceptable though. I pay for the service that you promise next day for me. I dont mean to be difficult but if you cant provide the service then don't promise it its false advertisement. i let the first couple of orders go through as late and havent complained because i understand sometimes a business has issues but you are continuously getting my custom because rather than me shopping elsewhere because i belive i am getting a service from you and i am not.[08:11:57] you can buy anything from asos from other shops.

Meaning all orders after the second are essentially free. Carrier delays and tech glitches are out of our controlbeth [08:17:40] i understand that and i really dont want to be difficult but you are being very condescending right now. If that is the case you should advertise premier as just 2 orders for 9.95 and not for the year on all your orders.ASOS[08:18:25] Your parcel is due to be delivered today please keep an eye on the tracking. Our premier terms and conditions do state that carrier delays and other delays are out of our control[08:19:43] Please use this link to our help page- http:/beth [08:19:49] Carrier delays and tech glitches although out of your control. you still are accountable to an extent for delivery of goods. As stated earlier that parcel which i believed to be delivered yesterday is going to my business where i will not be today and we shut over the weekend so that is no good to meASOS[08:22:01] You can use this tracking link to re-arrange or change the delivery http:beth [08:22:09] your customer service skills are appalling.ASOS[08:25:25] I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way. However I cannot change these delays. Here at ASOS we do all we can to ensure that orders arrive on time, however once orders leave us there is not much we can do. Espceially at this time of the year when carriers experience high amount of deliveriesbeth [08:27:57] I will be posting this script to facebook and instagram to let other people know that you are false advertising at this point and only care that 2 parcels get us next day to cover a 2 pound saving. you have been nothing but condescending and unapologetic about the whole situation. The company I work for is retail and i completlly understand carrier delays and shipment delays with all the holiday items being delivered across the world but at the end of the day if we were to deliver late to our customers we would be subject to charges and so put plans in place to avoid these situations. we are a small company and are putting these precautions in place so you as one of the largest retails have no excuse.ASOS[08:32:56] I'm sorry that you feel this way Beth. We refund delivery charges for all orders which are late and for faulty items. However as you have premier delivery we cannot refund this. We can only cancel it which means you lose your subscription. I've provided you with all the information I can however I cannot change the processes we follow. As I've said, premier delivery is not guaranteed, like other deliveries from anywhere there is always a chance there can be delays. We state this here in our terms and conditions- http:beth [08:35:19] Thats fine Sean. I will be voicing this on social media platforms like stated. Have a nice day.ASOS[08:35:55] If that’s everything for today, please close the chat when you're ready. Have a lovely day!beth[08:36:16] The chat has been ended

            I made a large order last week. After not receiving it, I tracked my order and it said it was signed at 13:01. I do not know where it was delivered as no card was left notifying me... Asos took 2 weeks to investigate and then told me they were satisfied It had successfully been delivered to my home address by DPD therefore implying I am being dishonest. I provided evidence from work showing I was at work at the time the person signed for it. Asos is unwilling to speak or have some common sense. I don’t even want a refund, I just want to know where my order is so I can go pick it up!  I keep receiving generic emails from them, not caring at all and repeating the same thing over and over again. I was told to report the matter to my bank so I could get refunded. But why exactly should my bank pay when the error comes from the DPD Driver? Now I spent a lot of money on an order someone else has.. And on top of that I am being accused of being fraudulent. I have been an Asos customer for more than 10 years and, prior to this incident, used to order on a regular basis with no issues whatsover.  Do not think ill re-order after that! The customer service is appalling and the way I was treated was too..

            Absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had. I ordered a couple of shirts (I’ve used ASOS many times in the past and my orders always came in fine) but once my delivery date came I never received anything. I tried reaching out to their online chat to ask the first rep says my items are held in customs (??????) then backtracks and says no actually they’re coming tomorrow. So I wait until the next day and nothing shows up again. So I use the online chat and the rep tell me they’re not coming until the 24th (I made the order on the 3rd!!!) due to “carrier delays”. They said they can look into if I don’t receive them on the 24th- if that was always an option then why aren’t you doing that now? Anyway, not using this service again.

            I order from asos all the time and usually it's fine but the next day delivery is abysmal. I ordered next day once before and it landed 4 days later. I never got a delivery charge refund at the time. Decided it may have been a once off problem and ordered next day delivery again this week for something this weekend. Received confirmation texts and emails to say it would be delivered by COB that following day. Today I get in touch via online chat only to be told that 1. Some items that i ordered and paid for aren't actually in stock, and 2. It will be with me Monday. So again, 4 days after ordering, not next day, after paying for next day and they won't acknowledge my request for a refund Disgraceful!

I had an issue this week with one of my parcels being stolen from the delivery van, so I used facebook messenger to talk to customer service and they offered me a full refund along with a £10 gift voucher, despite it not even being their fault. Overall, the staff were super helpful, the app is easy to navigate, and I love the product. They also have some great offers, like the premium delivery. Highly recommended.

            I ordered a parcel to arrive on Monday. Due to various issues with UK Mail it still hadn’t been delivered until today (Thursday). I contacted ASOS by chat twice. The first time I was told they would email me back after contacting the delivery company which never happened, and the second time I was on chat to them for 45 minutes and nothing got resolved. The second time they were supposed to get back to me as well, but haven’t as yet. I was told the only way I could formally complain was to email them via their website. I tried to do this 3 times and it wouldn’t send. I also tweeted them and tried to contact them via Facebook messenger and again was completely ignored. During the 45 minute chat I also requested a call back and this never happened. I have now managed to get the parcel but purely through spending hours on the phone (and a total of 8 phone calls) directly to the delivery company and finally insisting they sent my parcel to me via a courier due to the amount of mistakes they had made. The issues with the delivery company were down to them, but they wouldn’t allow me to complain and said I had to do so through ASOS who were zero help. ASOS should have dealt with the company for me but did not do so. I don’t usually have issues like this with ASOS, but this whole experience was so stressful and frustrating, it has left me seriously doubting whether I will continue to use their services. I still haven’t raised a complaint with them because no one has gotten back to me with a way that I can do so which works.

            Horrible customer service!!!! So I should have noticed that the company doesn't have a phone # to call in and discuss (big red flag!!!!) You can only chat/email/social media contact with them in which this certain rep. named Ebrima was extremely unsympathetic to my situation. I sent her multiple screens shots confirming that my item was not going to be in time and she offered no remorse. This purchase was for my birthday weekend!!! I had 1 prior purchase last year with them which went great!! But I will never give them my business again!! The item was supposed to be here today and now they're saying not until Monday. I ordered on 9/5 and shipping was supposed to be on 9/6 come to find out that they didn't ship it until 9/10!!!!

            Clothing quality is poor. Customer services pretty much unexisting. My trainers were delivered to the old address despite me changing to the new one. I was contacted by one of reps notifying me of that and promising to deliver item to the correct address (I was really impressed). However that didn't last long..  as I haven't heard from ASOS about rearranged delivery one week later, I have chased them up just to be told that they are out stock. I used ASOS for quite a few years now but it was certainly the last time. I better pay £10 more but get decent customer service and good quality goods from your high street retailers.

            I had a bad experience with Asos. I placed my order and paid with credit card. The order was supposed to arrive in 3 weeks (this time is more than enough for an item to arrive from UK to Mexico). It did not. I made I claim, and Asos told me that my order would take another 3 weeks. As you would imagine, the order did not arrive either. The only good thing is that Asos gave me my money back (after making a complaint, of course).

            I have been a customer with ASOS for over 8 years but my recent experience with them has completely put me off shopping with them again.I received my order on the 25th August and two items were missing. I spoke with 2 chat advisors who I hoped would be able to resolve the issue but unfortunately they could only reply with copy & pasted standard responses.I was advised that my issue would be referred to their 'specialist team' and I would receive a response in 12 days. I did not hear from them, so I decided to open a dispute on Paypal.A few days later, I received an email from ASOS explaining that I would need to re-order the missing items (which are now out of stock).I asked if they could send the message through Paypal directly, but they told me that due to GDPR, they could not respond to my Paypal dispute (which is complete nonsense!)I was then told that to receive a refund, I must close the Paypal dispute (which is very worrying, considering that the Paypal dispute system is there to protect customers from issues like this).I am really concerned that such a well known company as ASOS has such poorly training customer service advisors who apparently lack any understanding of Paypal and GDPR.It's now been 18 days since I received my order and I am still no closer to receiving a refund for the missing items. I am very disappointed in ASOS!

            Not satisfied, returned 2 vests that only cost £7, they kept the £3 delivery cost which is very cheeky - i know it costs money to ship items out, but its not as if asos are going broke (or are they?) and i`m sure they must get plenty of orders every week that keeps their online business running so they really should be refunding customers original delivery costs.Its okay when you buy something and are happy to keep it, but when you want to return something thats cheap and under £25 it actually turns out not to be so cheap because they are keeping the money that customers spent on delivery costs, asos need to look at other online stores that are offering free delivery or atleast free pick ups and need to learn how to please customers because this is putting a lot of customers off, i shall not be buying from them again.

            For such a 'Big' company the customer service is appalling. Used the live chat service and the representative I spoke to gave me a link on how to make a formal complaint to a manager. This link surprisingly didn't take me to a complaints page but took me to a fresh live chat with one of his peers. I explained to her that her colleague had clearly no clue and just fobbed me off. She obviously didn't bothered to read what i was saying and just said she couldn't help me with my original complaint. Getting more frustrated i asked for a manager to call me. She said they would call that night. I asked if they could call the next day which she said was fine and what time did i want them to call me. So the next day between 12-2 I awaited this manager call. The full day passed and the next day and the next. Then over 72 hours later a manager called. When I raised the fact he was to call me three days before he said yes it takes up to 48 hours for a call. On this response I said well you're 72 hours now before calling. To which he replied oh yeah we are busy. Explaining my situation to him he was as misinformed as the rest of the people I spoke to telling me one thing one minute and contradicting himself the next. He also confirmed that for bad customer service ASOS WILL NOT COMPENSATE the customer. WOW, what a great response from a company, even small online retailers have the customer at the forefront of the service. ASOS the customer is the one spending the money try at least to look after them a little bit and brush up on some entry level customer service. POOR POOR POOR. AVOID IF YOU CAN.

            I rejected the shipment!  Horrible customer service and shady business practices.  No clear information that customs and duties would be additional.  Made it appear items were coming from Canada.  No disclaimer during ordering or pop-up stating subject to customs or duties.  Customer service presented no options.  DHL Customs informed me that most companies just pay for the item or reduce the amount owing.  It was 1/3 the cost of my order.  It would appear Asos knows that if they don't alert the consumer, 80% will just pay the customs and not return the item.  Which equates to increased sales for Asos by not flagging the need for additional customs or duties.

            I reached level vvip on their rewards system and was looking forward to the benefits. I ensured I was allowing all communication from asos by email, and I checked several times on the app to make sure I was allowing email communication and even checked my spam box frequently to ensure I wasn't missing out on any vvip events. Then on Instagram I saw there was a vvip event which I knew nothing about. I keep my apps up to date and the asos app had recently updated so I went on to check the communication settings once again. This time the layout was different and even though on the previous communications layout I had allowed all email communications, the emails for the rewards system was turned off. I spoke to asos customer services about this and all they said was sorry and offered nothing to make up for me missing out on the vvip benefits through no fault of my own but because of an issue with their app. I've had other issues with asos such as not receiving a refund, but this was the nail in the coffin. I spent a lot of my money to get to vvip level and was looking forward to the level benefits - but it turns out it's just a ploy for customers to spend money and asos will do anything to prevent it's customers from having the benefits it promised.

            Very Hit or Miss...ASOS is great when you're in luck and you just so happen to stumble upon a ""good"" release cycle because not every cycle (i call it a ""cycle"" because the change-over period of its sold items on the site is too quick for it to be a season) is consistent. They also try their best to resolve any technical problems, though I feel they could try harder as I've been locked out of my ASOS account for over a year now and am unable to access it at all despite calling technical support for help.

            Asos used to be brilliant until they started cost cutting on delivery. DPD when they use them are fantastic never been let down once. Unfortunately they are using Hermes more and more and the service is shocking. Every single time they use Hermes my parcel arrives late. I always use next day delivery and if they deliver via Hermes it turns up two days late. The response from asos is just as poor sending copied and pasted text stating delivery times with no explanation as to why parcels are late or an apology. I will be using a different shopping site going forward as you cannot rely on asos anymore.

            I too paid the premium annual delivery service waste of time !!! I ordered 10.30pm on Thursday. Cut off is 11pm for next day delivery. I got an email Friday morning apologising that my delivery would not be today but instead would be Saturday. I left this as the things I ordered I don’t need until Saturday night although i was unhappy by the service. Saturday morning I received an email saying it had been dispatched. Then at 1pm I received a second email saying that as per MY request the order had been changed to Monday ??? I called DPD to ask why they said that the parcel had gotten there too late do go out to delivery today ?? I then called ASOS customer service who were unapologetic and quite rude. The guy after calling DPD himself leaving me on hold for 10minutes basically tried to blame me for doing the order to late for the next day delivery !!! I then pulled him up stating that even if that was the case the next day was Friday and it being delivered on Saturday shouldn’t have been a problem !! He just mumbled something at me that was pointlessI ordered a number of items worth over £500 to them and do so on a very regular basis Today I was left without anything to wear for my birthday. Did they care ?? Not at all. I asked why they advertise Ned day delivery on orders up to 11pm if they can’t do it ? I asked them what they will do about my order coming today he said nothing it will be there Monday. I told him to get it returned to them as I no longer want any of the items and will use a more reliable store in future. Still no aplogy offer of refund on next day delivery or anything else that will make me consider using them again. I have been ordering from here for years barely shopped anywhere else and now I will not bother again. My advise to anyone is do not rely on these people for anything you will be let down

I contacted #ASOS on live chat and they said as the day of the delivery hasn't passed yet they can't investigate, despite knowing the status.Day 2, I contact ASOS again and they said oh yeah there's an issue...someone on the ""specialist team"" will now look into this. I asked Aaron to just reissue my order so I get it tomorrow but no only a ""specialist team"" member can do this. Oh and I have to wait up to 6 days for this to be resolved. ⏳I frankly don't care about why it got delayed, I just want my order. I also pay for a Premium Service with ASOS yet get 1-2 star customer service. Not once did they apologise or offer a refund or simply say they'll re-order for me so I get it tomorrow. I have to now get caught up in their investigation 😴

            The website itself is fine and the products are generally good until you encounter an issue and have to deal with the customer service. I ordered a number of items for next day delivery and I even payed for the yearly next day subscription. The carrier was DPD and I received several texts and emails confirming the date and time of the pending delivery. The parcel was eventually delivered to, and signed for by, the wrong person, in the next town over. I know this because the DPD driver who made the delivery was in my neighbourhood only 20 mins after that and told me that the wrong delivery had been a mistake by the DPD's own computer system. Therefore I had to raise a 'signature dispute' with DPD, which I promptly did. DPD then referred me to ASOS to seek replacement of the order or a refund. ASOS customer services are, howeve,r abysmal. Yes, you get to chat online with someone right away. But they stonewall constantly, insisting on investigating the issue with DPD. This of course would have been fine had they actually been keeping up with the promise to update me on the status of said 'investigation', which was supposed to be over 48 hours and up to 5 working days in total. Well, three 'chats' with customer services advisors, a placating early email and over 10 days later, I am still without any updates, a refund OR the products I paid for. Needless to say, I've now cancelled the yearly subscription to the next day delivery service, as I won't be using this website again.

            Badly let down by service. Placed order almost 3 weeks ago, never received, no refund or update in the last 7 days. Courier lost my delivery, contacted ASOS, who didn’t really care, told me I’d have to wait for my order to be back in stock for a refund but how’s this going to happen if the courier has lost it! I don’t think it’s my responsibility because I’ve never seen the order, it’s not a return! Customer service was very poor, didn’t care about the issue. I’m now out of pocket as I’ve got no order, no refund and I’ve had to buy replacements. The worst is, had I not chased them and Yodel (for 5 days with very little answer) I’d never have known about the issue. Still waiting on an update from customer service but it’s been 7 days and I’m not holding out much hope.

Next day comes and I contact them, first person says that she can see my order is on it’s way to me, and an email was sent out so should be in my junk mail, which it clearly wasn’t, I go away tomorrow and now they have told me there was an issue with the warehouse so my order missed the cut off point for next day delivery!! Even though I ordered at 9pm, cut off time is 11pm. So I asked if they could change the delivery address, and they said no. Appalling and unacceptable, will NOT be shopping here ever again.

I have been waiting for my orders more than a month, I should have received them before my vacation started so I could use them, but guess what I had to buy the substitutes which I could wear, what made me spent another amount of money that I saved for the trip , I emailed them they told me to wait for 20 days, the 20 days has finished they told me to wait again for another 20 days, if theres any update they will be intouch. I refused to recieve any itme from their side and ask for refund, but there is no reply. I have been waiting for more than a day. I will never ever shop on that website.

            Like similar incidents I've read on this site about this company, I have had a not so good experience with customer service. I went on a honeymoon and received the wrong dress (after coordinating outfits with my husband). I bought shoes and jewelry to match the dress so in turn, I was extremely disappointed. I chatted with someone to check on the status of my return to find out it was being processed. I then asked if a coupon was possible and they said not and suggested I close the chat window if that was all I needed. Classic. I wish I could post screen shot. Jae was her ASOS chat name. Thank you.

            I'm writing this to try and help other people not be treated in the same way. I'm still in the process of trying to get my money back from them. Everytime I've contacted their customer service team, they've been completely unhelpful, to the point where it feels like they're actually doing everything they can to block me from resolving the situation and get my money back. I returned some items, not everything was processed, and they kept asking for proof of postage/returns to help me. ""You've received the packages, you've sent me emails to tell me this, I can send you your own emails as proof"". They would end the live chat sessions, not respond to my questions, and robotically answer that without that proof they couldn't help. Finally I found it in my spam folder and their tune changed completely. Still not helpful, but at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel. To anyone using ASOS, if you're using their free returns service, you have to keep a proof of return as their hard company line is, the goods are your responsibility until ASOS receive them. Their whole attitude to customer service is laughable, disgraceful, woeful, and when you try and complain, there's no help for you.

            I honestly don’t have the time to fully explain how poor the customer service is. A few examples include - no one takes ownership of an issue - customers keep receiving the same generic responses from different advisors- no one actually tries to help! I ended up finding out my package had never been sent to DPD whilst ASOS told me I had to wait til 10pm before they would investigate (DPD were very helpful)- they never contact you when they say they will- I phoned them a number of times and unfortunately got charged, until I managed to find a local number I could call (this doesn’t seem to be given on their app)- They do not value loyal customers- Their customer service representatives on twitter are often rudeThere is much more but I would be here all day.

            Been a customer of ASOS since the month it started as As  Seen On Screen. This week has been the second time I have had a problem with a delivery. The first time was many moons ago and was resolved really quickly and I was impressed that they just reordered the item for me and it was with me the following day. However, things have changed and this week having been forced to select free standard delivery on an order, despite having premier delivery on my account as the site would not offer it for this particular item, an item ordered on 27/08 and delivery due on or before 31/8 has failed to show up. Today is 3/9. I think it is unacceptable that I have to wait up 20 days for them to investigate why my item has not arrived. I need the item for a wedding this Friday!! I have found there chat system to be just a series of automated replies with no offer of assistance or an alternative. Tried asking for a refund as the wait was not acceptable and received a standard reply about only having an hour from placing an order to being able to cancel it. Again unacceptable as they have failed to honour the the contract of purchase. Terrible customer service.  Dispute now lodged with my bank for my money back.Request a refund at your own risk!!

Feels almost like a scam because by the time the specialist team reviews my order it will have passed outside the return window. Never shopping here again.

            Fraud??I suspect Asos are selling stock they do not have and benefiting from holding customers money.Lets look at it from a physical shop perspective. You walk into a shop, the cashier checks they have the size you need. Confirmed your sized items are in the store room you pay at the counter and the cashier goes to get your items. A long time passes so you ask floor staff where the cashier/your items are. The floor staff have no idea. As you continue to stand in the shop waiting, you spot another cashier.. Maybe they can help?! This cashier engages with you but states he does not know where the original cashier or your items but gives you a phone number (tracking number) which does not work. So you go back to this cashier to explain the number doesn't work and this time he acknowledges you have paid for the items but informs you Asos will be holding on to your money for now. However he assures you you can go home happy (without your items or your money!) because the customer service team will 'be in touch' in 18 DAYS.  Does this seem normal to you? When Asos FINALLY get in touch they do not know what happened to that cashier or your items and low and behold they are now out of stock of the items you originally paid for?! Whether it's clear cut fraud or not, Asos are breaking their obligation to uphold the Consumer Agreement Act by failing to deliver products purchased within the agreed delivery date. I urge anyone who is experiencing these issues with Asos to seriously consider opening a dispute. I also urge anyone considering buying from this company to read all the reviews you can find (there are numerous reviews similar to mine).There needs to be an investigation into Asos conduct. Watch this space! Asos seem to have a positive reputation in the past so perhaps they have changed management? Perhaps they are now on the brink of bankruptcy and have to go to the measures of selling stock they do not have to stay afloat? Perhaps it is just fraud and they are relying on those customers who do not open disputes? Perhaps they are actually just seriously incompetent (this one seems the most far fetched!). Maybe Asos should advertise for short term investment for zero return - this is what they are doing only consumers are conned into doing so!?BE VERY AWARE!

            Did not deliver my order because they “had a problem with getting the order out of their warehouse”. So I just got an email out of nowhere that said “confirmation of returned goods”. When I contacted them they said that the money would be transfered back to my account in the next two weeks. Since I really needed the things I ordered I was pushed to paying twice for my order and turns out most of the item I previously ordered were either sold out or not on sale anymore; when I contacted asos about this they said there was nothing they could do. I still decided to order, the second order was then not delivered until 9 days later, 4 days after the date they said that it should be delivered. Not happy at all about this.

            I'm usually a little wary of ordering clothing online- I'm a chubby gal and have been burned before with clothing running much smaller than the size I ordered, but ah. C'est la vie!  ASOS swooped into my life randomly after I commented on a customers cute shirt & they pointed me in their direction. I tentatively decided to check it out, and since their prices were reasonable I decided to order a couple things just to try them out. Not only did everything fit me comfortably & correctly, but my order got here in 3 days, and I didn't even pay for any kind of expedited shipping!? I was shook. I still am. My boots are wonderfully made, my denim jacket isn't too rigid {it's actually more of a relaxed denim and I love it}, and THE TIGHTS, which I tend to have issues with bc my thighs & midsection don't like to agree on where they should rest, ARE PERFECT. They don't roll down, they don't dig in. 10/10 my favourite tights. I've only had my stuff for 4 days or so, but I tell ya- I'm happier than a vampire in a low-security blood bank! I'll definitely be coming back for more stuff.

            I love Asos, the quality of clothes is great and quality price ratio is good too. Even if clothes just don fit me, they're still generally looking good. I am just very disappointed with delivery, Hermes that they're using is terrible and their couriers just lie. I am thinking that this was my last purchase as I have payed 150£ and payed for next day delivery and at the end after three days I have to pick up the parcel on my own. Please change delivery company! You're losing so much!

            It feels as though ASOS is trying to avoid buyer fraud by treating their loyal customers like criminals. They ""never received my return"" (which I mailed over a month ago) and that is ""my responsibility"" even though I did everything I was instructed to in order to make the return. They insist I need proof of postage, although they don't provide a tracking slip like most retailers do. They refer to the fine print that buyers would have to dig through legalese to find, then end the chat before the issue is resolved for the customer. They are resting on their laurels and don't care if they upset a buyer. Furthermore, I suspect that there are robots rather than humans on their customer help chat.

            Ordered an item 9 days in advance for a wedding. I don’t have the Asos next day delivery as I don’t use the site that often but every time I have used it previously it has been reasonably good for delivery and quality. So anyway I ordered a dress 9 days in advance of when I need it for thinking it would be here on time. It is due today and earlier in the week I started worrying about where my item is so I contacted ASOS a total of 3 times to ask. Each person on the online chat service assured me it would be here on time (Friday 31st). So I check daily and the item says dispatched- brilliant! However when I go into track the item the courier hasn’t actually received my item.So I told Asos this but no they assured me there was a delay in Update with tracking details.So it’s Friday 31st. I still haven’t received my item. I contacted them tonight and they told me to wait until 10pm. Well it’s 10 and still no item. I knew 100% earlier in the week from the lack of communication from them and the courier that it wouldn’t be here in time for the wedding - at which I’m doing a reading. Being the trusting person I am shouldn’t have believed the lies of “it will be here by Friday”. Now I have nothing to wear tomorrow to match my remaining outfit and was foolish enough to believe them instead of trusting my instincts! It seems to me unless you pay for their delivery next day service even if you do order in advance for your items they’re not interested! 9 days it should have 100% been here as standard delivery can take between 4-5 working days! Frustrated.Update: They lost my order. Won’t refund me for 15-18 days as they have to investigate.

            Don't know what's going on with ASOS now but will never shop with them again. Paid for annual next day delivery and have been told will not receive package until next week. Customer service are rude and unhelpful and ended the conversation without the issue being resolved. I've been shopping on ASOS for years and have always been happy with the service but maybe it's new management or new shipping contracts that have created problems. Anyway, won't be shopping there again.

            I have an order I'm still waiting on even though ASOS said I'd have it delivered 3 days ago. When I chatted to their representatives they said they couldn't help and had no idea where my order was??? And that if I don't have it by September 12th, they would ""look into it""? Is this a joke? Am I being punished for not paying the extra 15 euros for express shipping? Have I spent my money for my parcel to go missing? In case you aren't aware, I could have also grabbed that money and threw it in the fireplace, I wouldn't have my dress but at least it would provide some light entertainment. If you can't guarantee that I will EVENTUALLY receive my parcel, then you should just force people to pay the extra 15 euro for shipping. Or at least let us know that you strap parcels on donkey's bags and give them a kick in the back and hope for the best.

            I have ordered with Asos for several years and never had any complaints- though until now have had no reason to contact customer service. I paid for items on Tuesday 28th August and paid for express delivery (gift fit husbands birthday) to arrive on or before August 31st. By 3pm,order had not arrived so contacted customer service. On round one,was asked to log on via e mail and re contact via this method/ live chat. On doing so, my account was 'locked' by asos,told to contact customer care again. On second attempt via live chat,told to log on via my account- I had to explain this was not possible as asos had locked my account. Advised that my query would need to be passed to another person etc etc who would contact me by e mail! Two hours later,asos had not bothered to make contact via e mail and my order had not arrived. I contacted Customer service yet again (third attempt) pleading for help- all I wanted to do was find where my order was given I had paid in full for my goods and paid for express delivery. Told to wait for an e mail and my request could not be processed whilst my account was still locked. Two hours later and my order has not been delivered nor have asos had the courtesy to resolve my account issue,or made any effort to help me locate my order. Appauling customer service Asos- we are paying customers and fobbing people off and wasting our time is completely unacceptable. Perhaps highlighting these issues via social media might be the most appropriate option for dissatisfied customers going forward.

            After buying my usual size shoe in a 7, the product that arrived was at least one size too big although marked as a 7. Stupidly on my part, I threw away the packaging thinking buying some insoles would help. They didn’t, so I contacted ASOS to ask if they would accept the return without the box. I was told they could not confirm whether or not the warehouse would accept and refund if not sent with the box. To be sure I was correct in thinking there was basically nothing they could to do help I asked “so there’s nothing you can do to resolve my issue” the agent replied “no, next time I suggest you refer to the size chart to avoid mistakes such as this” obviously the size chart recommended a 7. Not only did they sell me an overpriced, poor quality product, they couldn’t even have the decency to help me return it. Nor could they even have basic respect for their customer.

            Really poor service. Late delivery and didn't even send the items that I ordered, they sent substitutes! Their next day subscription is a scam - they can send your order by UK mail which has no chance of reaching you the next day. Customer service reps can be very unhelpful - one even implied that I was lying about not receiving a delivery because the courier's GPS tracker was logged at my address. This means they consider a delivery to be attempted if a van pulls up in your street, not by an attempt to ring your doorbell or knock at your door. Cannot believe how many ways they managed to mess up my order. I anticipate a new battle to get my refund. Their partnership with Hermes is a recipe for disaster.

            My experience has been horrible and has gone so far as to cause me anxiety and stress over the whole situation. I ordered a bikini on the 14th of August on the Australian website. When I receive the item after a little while, they seem to have sent me the wrong size. Whether or not that comes from a faulty conversion between the Australian and UK website or from a mistake when sending the item, I don't know, but the fix is fairly simple: For them to send me the item I originally ordered, and for me to return the other item. However, it did not turn out to be that simple.I contacted ASOS via chat straight away, and was told they would send my issue to a ""specialist team"". When asked how long it could take, they told me that due to high workloads it could take up to 10 days. I also contacted ASOS via Facebook, and after being asked for my order number and email, they stopped replying. On the 29th I got a response telling me I'd been sent a replacement, but in the message, they told me the size was the same as the one I originally got (which was, of course, the incorrect size), so I asked them straight away if the size they were to send would be the right size or not, and the person copied and pasted the original message. No answers were given. I even provided pictures and a simple explanation in case they misunderstood, but still received no answer on Facebook or chat.I then went on to call customer service via the phone. This included me having to pay for credits to call a UK phone number, but at this point, I had tried every single option. I call and am quite quickly put in touch with a very helpful lady on the other end. She tells me they can't know for sure what size I've been sent as a replacement until it arrives, and she's very apologetic and generally a nice lady (only positive reply so far). So I am told to wait until it arrives, and so I do.The parcel arrives, and they've sent me the same WRONG size once again. I contact customer service via chat as the phone is not open yet, and am told to keep waiting. The person doesn't even answer any of my questions, and basically tells me to wait for an email, but what I'm waiting for and for how long I have no idea. He then proceeds to just end the chat abruptly.

            I normally would rate ASOS 5 stars because I love them and their clothes but this time around I’m extremely disappointed. I ordered 5 items totaling over $200. I ofcourse did two day shipping. When my package arrived it was open and only had one it. I immediately informed ASOS care team and got no response. I’ve sent a minimum of 5 emails as well as contacted them on messenger and on instagram. I have gotten no response at all. They don’t care that my items were stolen before I received my package and they don’t seem to have any concern to attempt to handle my situation or even contact me back to acknowledged what was going on. Thank God for my bank being great and reversing the transaction but overall ASOS you lost a loyal customer. Shame on you all

My order was placed on August 4th due to be delivered August 16th (lengthy delivery but I live in New Zealand so I understand). My order did not arrive and I received an email informing me there had been an issue with the courier and to allow another one-two days. The parcel did not get delivered so I spoke to he customer care team, they asked me to wait until the 28th, it still didn’t arrive, after speaking to another member of the customer care team they are now asking me to allow another 15 days!!! Up until now the customer care team have been informing me my order is on track which is clearly a lie. Waste of my time.

            VERIFIED PURCHASE. So... I ordered trousers and a tie on the 14th August. My delivery due date was 16th August. That day came and went with no updates from Asos or the courier. I was told by the courier Hermes that the item was lost but Asos still did not trust that and said I had to wait until the 25th, then they said 26th, then 28th. 28th came and they have now said. 'yeah you have to wait another 17 days so our 'team' can look into it. I expected at the least an offer of a refund or re-delivery but no. They make the customer pay for company mistakes by making them wait longer! So I will find out after a MONTH of waiting. Absolute joke of a company, do not order from them under ANY circumstances. Find another company that does the same thing better, It will not be hard.

            I only have had positive experiences with ASOS. I purchased premier membership which includes next day delivery for the year and everything I’ve ordered arrives next day. The quality of the clothes are excellent and the do last, prices are great too. I’ve bought some designer items for less than half price in sales so I love shopping with them.

            Order placed for next day delivery. Order doesn’t arrive. Contact company live help to ask where the parcel is.Told that a “specialist team” will look into it and they will contact me within 15 days – surely, customer service could use the miraculous invention of a telephone to contact their courier to inquire, but apparently it takes a fortnight for them to find the intelligence to do this.Ask for details of a manager as this ‘service’ is not good enough. Refused.Ask for a contact email address to raise complaint of lack of ‘customer service’ – advised to use webform on website – apparently they don’t have an email address to raise complaints directly. ‘Customer service’ rep on live help then robotically reiterates it takes fifteen days as they are very busy – I state this is not good enough, then patronising ‘customer service’ rep advises to close the live chat window and ‘to have a lovely day’. Patronising, ignorant and arrogant moron.

            My delivery (350768509) was not delivered after it said it had been. I chased their online 'help' team 5 times to discuss the matter. On the third time, I was promised, in writing, either my parcel or a refund and now on the 4th and 5th occasion (after chasing them AGAIN) I have been told ASOS wont do this. Im a very loyal and premier customer of ASOS who has spent hundreds of pounds with the company and I am astounded that they wont refund me for their own mistake. If I could give ASOS 0 stars I would. As an online retailer you'd expect their customer care would NEED to be excellent or else lose customers. Indeed, Boohoo.com once misdelivered a parcel to me and refunded the money without hesitation.

            First off let me start off by saying that back then asos's had really nice prices and quality products but lately i have been seeing some ordinary products go for around $200 and $300 for stuff i can by at a boutique for cheaper and to add more insult to injury asos's representatives were very rude to me in a complaint ( which by the way was offered freely by asos's saying "" what is your feedback/ "" tell us how we are doing"" ) so i did and when i confronted them about their prices and products one of the asos's reps replied "" if you don't like our services then please shop elsewhere"" and guess what i still have that very hurtful email its sad to see a company who makes millions off others hard earn money just to treat customers like trash we are people too asos's we are people too!!!!

The first parcel I was expecting for my son's birthday, and it arrived the day after his birthday.  The second parcel I ordered on 25/8/18 and I've been told there's a delay and I have to allow until 31/8/18 for delivery, which is nearly a week. I've contacted ASOS customer care both times, and they're attitude is basically 'you'll have to wait' and they've offered no other form of discount or anything.  RUBBISH CUSTOMER CARE!

            ASOS customer service and response time is seriously the worst, worse than China-owned online stores. First incident: I emailed ASOS about an order return and they only replied it after 4 weeks. Lucky, I got through their online chat with one of its customer officers and managed to get some answers after 2 days. SO, DON'T EMAIL THEM. Second incident: currently, my order (a pair of $50 shoes) is one month late from ASOS' estimated delivery date. ASOS insisted I wait another 7 days before they are willing to ""PASS ON MY INQUIRY TO ITS SPECIALIST TEAM"" and will 'GET BACK TO ME IN 12 DAYS VIA THEIR GODDAMN EMAIL"". Really, by the time they are willing to ship another pair, it should be at least 2 months since their supposed shipment date. Hopefully, my feet won't grow another size. And hopefully, I won't have to return it.  This is 2018. We are so connected by internet and advanced technology today BUT looks like ASOS has missed the ship and is lagging behind. Waiting more than 1 month for a delivery to be resolved is unbelievable. I can understand shipment might get lost or thrown away by funny post people, but the way ASOS tries to resolve delivery issues is ridiculous by today's standards. Quality of Aliexpress and Taobao items might be dubious for some, but at the very least, these Chinese companies are adamant to resolve delivery issues when they are informed of one. ASOS is seriously still stuck in 2012. Last time ordering from ASOS. In the meantime, I'm going to spend some time and buy a pair of shoes from a physical store.

            Paid £9.95 for premier delivery for a year. They closed my account as I was a victim of fraud and told me to open a new one, which I did. Was promised I'd be refunded but have not. I purchased a new premier delivery on my new account then that was closed 2 days later - apparently again due to fraud.No no one will speak to me as both of my accounts have been blocked and I've just been spoken to like a criminal by customer services. I have paid for 2 premier deliveries and I want my money back. ASOS closed my accounts and effectively stole money from me. Now they won't even tell me whom I can speak to to resolve this.

            Very on and off. Some products are very poorly made but some are lovely. Delivery can either be on time or late. Sometimes you get the right product but sometimes they send you something completely different.

            When you receive the wrong item, tell them and then get an answer that you need to wait for a specialist to look through it and get back to you in 10 working days. Then because it was a gift tell them you are in a hurry and can't wait for that long and they tell you to send it back and order it again. You do and two weeks later you are still waiting for a refund! I contacted them again today(14 working days after) asking what is going on only for them to tell me that a specialist will look through it and they will get back to me in the next 18 working days.

            This was my first time shopping apparels online and after googling I found out that ASOS was one of the best website recommended. I was impressed with the 2 days delivery service (even though they charge $8). The cloth quality was ok, however, the pant waist size was more by an inch. When I tried to contact their customer service via chat, it took some time to get connected as I was put in a queue. Once I was connected the representative never replied.

I have been shopping with ASOS for years and I have had some bad experiences but usually the customer service team has been helpful, however the same cannot be said on my last experiences shopping with them. I ordered a dress for a wedding I was attending in Spain. They send the dress two sizes smaller than I ordered and when contacted they told me I should return the dress and get another one because the one I ordered was out of stock. They did not offer a next day delivery voucher nor a discount for the inconveniences. The advised me a specialist team would contact me within 12 days (like that is acceptable) to speak to me. Fast forward 17 days later, and I have yet to receive a call from their specialist team, the item I sent 16 days ago had not even reached their warehouse, no refund has been made and they are telling I now need to wait another 12 days for another specialist team to call me back to resolve my issue (maybe the previous specialist team went on holidays or something). In any case, this has been my last shopping with them after many years of loyalty, I have never been more let down by a company. It is unacceptable that they only look after their benefit with total disregard for the customers.

It's my first time ordering from ASOS, ordered 1 item that costs S$36 or so on the 8th of August 2018, and it was shipped out on the 10th of August 2018.The estimated delivery date as 20th August 2018. It's the 23rd of August and I have not received my item. They did not provide a tracking number for my item, probably because my item was too low cost for them to do so. I have wasted a good few hours of my time trying to track the item but to no avail. ASOS has caused me a great inconvenience.I find that very irresponsible and quite honestly lacking from such a big company. They should at least send out a notice stating they they will be sending it as a registered item. It's only today that I learnt that it's by ordinary post if there isn't a tracking number.It's safe to say that this will be the first and the last time I will ever shop with ASOS. I will never patronise your online store ever again.

            Ordered clothes with a value of 150£ the 20th August, it got shipped the 22nd of August and arrived the 23rd. And this with their Free Standard Delivery. It was expected to arrive the 5th of September but came two weeks earlier. I am pleased. I also talked to the customer service and they were really nice and quick providing a detailed and informative response.

            Always shopped at Asos but recently placed a large order - 2 expensive items missing from parcel. Was told by customer services they could not locate them, so they were refunding one (out of stock) and resending the other. Received the replacement, it didn’t fit so was returned. Haven’t received a refund for either item despite Asos claiming to have processed them 2 weeks ago?!Fobbed off numerous times by ‘customer services’ and have now had to open a PayPal claim as they owe me almost £350 and seem intent on avoiding refunding it.There are plenty of other stores to buy from, I will not shop here again and judging by the numerous comments from others on social media I’m not the only one. 👋🏻

            After reading all the reviews I was almost certain I would not receive my refund! well to my surprise my refund hit my account 15 days after i returned the item, also communication was very good with the followup emails from asos that they received my return and processed. I have been shopping with them for 7 years quality is very good on most of the items, a couple of the dresses where cheap material but overall I have kept 98% of what was sent to me.

            Literally the worst customer service ever. Sent the wrong item, which happens but the problem is they way it's been dealt with - basically told the processing time for exchange was 10 days and if I wanted the correct pair to re order them and send back the other ones for a refund - therefore I'm the one that's out of pocket even though it's ASOS's issue, no compensation and barely an apology. They did not try to rectify the issue and made a loyal customer very annoyed. Up until now I've never had a problem with ASOS - Really disappointing...

            Not suprised when I come on here and see how many 1 star reviews over the past few days. Just spoke to an adviser who was no help. Asked for a manager 3 times. Waiting 16 minutes on the phone . Spoke with who was no better then his colleague. I mistakenly selected the wrong delivery and realised when I was notified my order would not arrive until Wednesday 29th August from Monday 20th. Tweeted this morning and was told there is a delay with standard orders which is fine. Asked if could pay to upgrade was told no and asked if I could cancel and re-order, again told no. 0 customer service from ASOS.

            I ordered items 2 days ago for next day delivery, contacted them via their “chat” last night and it was 10 to 10, they told me I had to wait until 10pm then contact them tomorrow (today) I’ve now just been told by parcel is not going to arrive until 27th which is next week! And I need them items by tomorrow! They have really distressed me as I have no time to order anything else! They only offered to remove the postage!

            I was guaranteed my order would arrive on or before the 8th. I ordered a backpack and school started on the 10th, so I figured I would definitely receive it before then, and if there was a delay there was a few days to spare. The tracking showed that it would be delivered on the 7th. It did not arrive. I contacted customer service and asked what happened, and they said there was a delay, and that I needed to wait at least another week. They would not give me and discount or refund for this trouble. After a few more days the package was shown as out for delivery. It once again didn’t arrive. I once again asked customer service what happened, and they said they will look into it and get back within a week. Three days later, the package finally came. I don’t believe ASOS customer service was ever notified it was delivered, because they sent a replacement order. I asked to cancel it and they wouldn’t, I guess I get extra stuff at least. All in all the customer service was nice, but they didn’t offer any solutions to my problem. They just sent a generic response (asking for information I already gave them, so this response must be some sort of mandated copy pasted reply) and then when I clarified more they said they will look into it. I won’t be ordering from ASOS again because it was a huge hassle and I was constantly wondering where my package was and getting upset when it didn’t arrive by the deadline.

            My order never arrived. Turned out it was delivered to a different address. ASOS sent me a courier photo of an unfamiliar door at an unidentifiable property which was completely different from all the past courier photos of my actual door. Despite this, they stated that it had been delivered somewhere - so their job was done - and that I should just go and locate the property as it was probably a house within my area. So, with nothing but a photo of a random door, ASOS expected me to go searching for my delivery. Two ASOS representatives have so far refused me a refund. My complaint has been raised for a third opinion. I'm never ordering from there again.This. Is. Absolutely. Ridiculous.

            I always order from ASOS as my first point of call whenever I need anything - with their unlimited next day delivery for a year for £10 you can't go wrong!! Sometimes the sizes are a bit funny, but that's normally if you order from the different brands rather than the actual ASOS stuff - I have had issues with delivery before, but that's normally down to the delivery people, or ASOS make you aware of any delivery issues.

            Been as Asos customer for a year. I made three orders in July. The first was due for delivery on August 7 and the second two were due on August 15.I received the one of the packages that was due to arrive on August 15 last week. I contacted them about the August 7 package and they said I should receive it by end on day (Thursday the 16th) — needless to say it didn’t come and they were lying because they had no way of being able to tell. They told me to wait until Sept 5 for the other package because of possible postal delays in my area. I said there were no postal delays because I received a package I ordered on the same day last week. I live in a remote area and order online a lot and I’ve never had an issue with a package or with Canada Post. This sounds fishy to me.I see they’ve removed their Chat Now feature.

            I have shopped on ASOS for 2.5 years, made 30+ orders and 10+ returns during this time. Most of my returns were because I had bought more than one size or didn't like the fit.I haven't had any issues up until last month where one of my orders had the wrong item sent. ASOS had the wrong pictures up for the item so when they offered to replace my items, they sent me the wrong item again. It took over a month to get my money back through PayPal but eventually the issue was resolved. I will admit it was a pain in the neck, but it isn't stopping me from buying from ASOS. ASOS offers free shipping and returns (at least in Australia) which is something you don't often get from international online shopping websites and their items/retailers are legitimate.If you are worried, use PayPal because they are often on the buyer's side and as long as you have evidence, you should be fine. Keep all your receipts and emails until you are satisfied with your order. If you chat to ASOS with a problem with your order, screenshot everything (with dates if possible).  If you are returning something, keep the tracking number until ASOS has sent you your refund. As with many places in-store, no receipt = no refund.

            Really put off shopping here again. I’d purchased a £145 item for next day delivery which didn’t arrive. I contacted them to be told that they are getting the specialist team to look into it and will be back with a reply in a the next few days. A few days past and nobody contacted me so I contacted them again via their chat which is useless, the staff on there are not very helpful and some are just rude. A few of them even closed the chat when I said about the issue. I was polite and friendly towards them so there was no reason for them to do that. I placed the order on the 22nd of June and had to wait over a month for my money back which is really unacceptable. They haven’t offered me anything as a good will gesture for all the time and hassle. I had no idea when I would be getting my money back as they said there was no time scale for this so I rang my bank to get them to sort it. I don’t think I will be purchasing anything else from here in the future because of what happened and how it was dealt with which is a real shame for myself and ASOS really. They might have kept me as a customer if they had offered something as an apology.

            I've ordered a size 12 shoes, but received a size 11. When I contacted them to address the issue, they did not take responsibility of their mistake, but told me that it is my fault if they did not send the right size. The customer representative that I talked to was Alex. He told me that ""I'm more than welcome to return the item"". But the problem is that the total value of my order was more than $150, which granted me a 2 days free shipping. But since I want an exchange, I will have to pay a 2 day shipping fee, and wait at least a week for them to receive the item, so that they can send me back my money. This is really disappointing for a company that seems to have a bright future due to their products. They really need to work on the quality of the services provided by their customer representatives.

            I had a really bad experience returning an item with ASOS. I had bought the same 100$ dress in 2 different size (UK 10, Uk 8), so that I could try then on, and return the one that didn't fit. I had asked for an express delivery (15$) because I was leaving for vacations, and needed them urgently. I followed the instructions for returning an item and asked for a refund for the UK 10.  A week later, I received an email that they have received my package, and that they shipped the new order.... with the UK 8 (which I already have).... while I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR AN EXCHANGE!! Now a SECOND 15$ was billed again to my credit card without my approval, and because I live in Canada and they are taxes for import goods, I'm asked to pay another 30$ of taxes for the UK 8 that ASOS wrongly sent. Of course, I sent an email to ASOS to resolve this issue a few days ago, and they never replied. I refuse to pay for the reshipping to return this wrong delivery, but I'm scared to encounter the same problem if I sent this item again for a refund.

In the past 2 weeks I have had THREE incorrect items delivered to me with nothing offered in terms of an apology for the inconvenience. One of the incorrect products was actually re-sent to me again - shocking! No number, I usually communicate via Twitter. All I get is a spiel about how to return the item which trust me by now, I know the process!! Can't be sure I'm going to receive the correct item and with the returns period dragging out over 10 days.. might as well shop elsewhere!

They do not take responsibility for their mistakes they take forever to refund you and apparently they don’t know how to put a suit together and send it out.

            I’ve used ASOS several times now, when they get it right in all fairness they’re quite good, this rating and review is solely based on my latest experience, I have in the past given them 4 stars, but alas you’re only as good as your last experience, my complaint on this occasion is based on their premier next day deliver service, I pay £10 a year for next day delivery on all orders,they failed on this occasion and didn’t meet the next day promise, when you pay for a specific service I expect to get that service, I started an online chat with a customer service agent called Hannah, I found her less than helpful, unsympathetic and just giving scripted answers and a tracking number to track my order, she didn’t seem to grasp that I was upset at paying for a service that I was not getting, when I signed up for premier next day delivery, it said I would get next day on all orders, not some orders, I’m very disappointed to not have my products on the day I wanted and the day I paid for, Hannah just said I can not help you further so I’m ending the chat, how rude

            I have used ASOS before and i’ve had very good experience with them until now. I placed on order on 9th August and chose to have a standard delivery (it was supposed to be here by 16th August) as it has always arrived earlier before. Not this time though! They did not even bother to update me about my delivery status. I had to message to ask them. Apparently, it has been delayed and I MIGHT get it by 27th August, but I should keep it on my mind that is a bank holiday as well. Also they told me I shall get in contact with them if it DOES NOT come and then they can go from there.... I think it is a bit of poor service from them. Pprobably it is the delivery company’s fault, but then I don’t understand why ASOS is not doing anything about it as they know their customers are unsatisfied about this service. It makes me very disappointed too!

            I ordered a few things off ASOS for the first time last week. Fast forward to yesterday, when Hermes claimed they would deliver between 9am and 1pm. Then Hermes said they'd deliver between 3pm and 8pm. Fine. This morning, they said they'd deliver today. Lunch rolls around and the courier comes to my door to explain that he misdelivered my parcel yesterday and has been unable to retrieve it after several attempts. (His honesty is appreciated, at the very least.) Hermes have now marked the parcel ""delayed"". However, ASOS insist that there is nothing to be done, and that I wait until 28 August, whilst they hold on to my money, because ""it is within the time frame and the parcel can still be delivered"". No refund, no replacement, just... bugger off and let us keep your cash! Worst possible first (and last) experience of their customer service.Update: as of 28 August, no resolution. ""Contact us again tomorrow if it hasn't been delivered, and we'll pass you on to a specialist team to investigate! But there's a 15-queue wait for investigation."" Kafka-esque doesn't begin to describe it.Update 2: as of August 29, have been passed to a ""specialist team"" who will contact me ""in the next 17 days"". You can bet I'll be back here once that happens. Already wish negative stars were a possibility...

            I think ASOS is a brilliant company that I order from all the time . I am subscribed to the premiere delivery which is free next day delivery on any item for a yearly cost. I think it’s worth it considering all the brands on there! So many different ways to return and exchange items also. Always got quick refunds when needed with prepaid labels and resealable bag. Recently they’ve been using Hermes for delivery which has been pretty rubbish ! Deliveries have not been on time or they have not come on time to collect parcels. Usually this is not the case.

            My order took three days to dispatch - compared with other online retailers I find this to be disappointing. However, this was not even the worst part of my experience. The order did not arrive on the predicted day, and still has not arrived a week after. The tracking message states my order has not even been given to the courier, yet ASOS claim to have dispatched it. I have reached out to ASOS on email and on live chat and have been told that I will have my problem sorted within 12 days. A few days in and I can tell that this will be a long wait. Overall, it looks as if it will have been a month by the time I get my parcel, or that I will not get my parcel at all! My order is over £100 so I am very stressed about this.

            Ordered an item for my sons 18th birthday, paid the extra cost for next day delivery it arrived and was the wrong item . I then rang them and done an online chat as the phone call was no help and neither was the online chat. I explained that the correct item needed to be sent out immediately as I was desperate to get it in time for his birthday and they refused and said there was nothing they can do and to just f me to send the item back and await a refund this meant my son didn’t get his present and they didn’t give a toss. Worst company ever to deal with stay well clear if it was possible to give them less than 1 star I would.

            Ordered click and collect, received a tracking number saying that the product would be with me the next day. On the date of the delivery, they texted me driver was delayed. That was the last I heard from anyone. I got in touch the next day asking what happened, as the tracking number was now saying the parcel was returned. Received a terribly dismissive reply from the customer service: ""Parcels can be returned to us because the carrier has not been able to locate the address, has left a calling card and has not received a response or due to the parcel being refused at the delivery address. (I ordered click and collect)We're unable to resend your order to you. As soon as we've received the parcel, we'll refund the cost of the items and send you an email to let you know. Please allow 11 working days for your parcel to arrive at our warehouse. (My funds are being held hostage until they sort the mess they created!)""Not going back, the only appeal of Asos to me is the convenience, and this experience wasn't convenient at all. I have problems on my foot and I only go back to Asos because of their wide fit shoe selection, but with the mess and their dismissal of my situation, it is really not worth it. I feel powerless and frustrated at their treatment. Sorry for the long rant, I am terribly disappointed.

            I am really dissapointed. Shopped for the first time at Asos and bought expensive Nike shoes, I ordered size 38, but they send me 37,5. Shoes I really liked but they are too small because they made mistake. Now I have to send it back and wait for refund. Such a waste of time :( I have shopped in other online stores for years but they never made mistakes like this. It is really dissapointing!Btw, I wrote the letter to customer service and they told me they send another pair with right size. I told them specificly which size I need, and they AGAIN SEND ME THE WRONG SIZE !!! How hard it is to look at the shoe and see if it is 38 or 37. Not ordering anything from ASOS ever again!

I ordered a dress but a pair of jeans came in its place, took photos of the error, sent it back on 4th July 2018, Royal Mail says it has arrived. No refund, wrote to customer service 5 times seperate times, each time asking for me to wait 10-12 business days, which i patiently did. it is now 16th Aug 2018, still no avail. All i ask for is for my £16.50 to be refunded, which is rightfully mine. Escalated to PayPal, no response from seller (ASOS). Still waiting for my money to be returned.

            I have just had a ridiculous experience with Asos and having been a customer for circa 10 years, I think I will forget ordering from them again.I received a 20% off code for my birthday which was at the end of July. I wasn't able to use this within the time frame so I just used the online chat facility to ask whether it could be extended for me to make an immediate order (of over £100). I was completely upfront about the matter as above and the flat answer was 'no'. I responded to say the same thing had happened with Feelunique and they were more than happy to provide a new code within seconds. The response from ASOS (Darby) was incredibly curt and rude and I was told ""If that is all, close the window when you're ready"". Awful customer service and will no longer use or praise the company as I once did.

I placed one order last year with you and then this one and your calling me a liar ! Saying that I’ve kept goods when I’ve tried to deal with this quickly and provided evidence to show you that items were missing from my order due to the packaging being wide open! I took photos  and got in contact with you straight away! And now your telling me that your not going to be having any further contact with me! Well the items I received are unsuitable and I am entitled to a refund as per statuary customer rights! I wanted these items for my holiday hence why I’ve been in contact straight away and you are calling me a liar ! I think it’s rude and extremely poor customer service the snotty email that’s been sent to me!  Absolutely disgusting !! If I had been placing lots of orders and claim items were ‘missing’ I could possibly understand why you may have sent the email but this is my 2ND ORDER IN 2 FRIGGING YEARS I SHOWED YOU PHOTOSOF HOW THE PACKAGE WAS GIVEN TOME AND WHAT ITEMS WERE INSIDE!Further more I’ve since refunded the 5 items took pictures of what I was returning and a picture of the proof of postage and yet I’ve still only been refunded for 3 pairs of shoes!!!

Contacted customer service and they said they would get back to me in 12 days even though I said I needed this item for Saturday and it was there mistake. All I got was an apologie and asked to send it back for a refund in 12 days. I have ordered from several websites and these mistakes do arise sometimes but everytime these other company’s have rectified there mistakes immediently and sent out another replacement. Next even have my husband £40 compensation for a mistake they made and sent out a replacement. This company clearly doesn’t care that they have ruined my holiday by sending out a top 2 sizes to big! The incompetence of this company is utterly appalling. The customer service here use to be great but this is a complete and utter joke.

            I wish I could give this company 0 stars. 2 of my bridesmaids ordered their dresses from this site. The first dress ordered was the Maya Maternity Embellished Maxi Dress. She received it in good timing and we were super excited but upon opening it we realized it was completely wrong. The beading, actual color of the dress, material, everything was completely wrong. The beading was coming off of it and just dangling all over the top. I reached out to customer service who said I’d hear back in 10 days. Never heard back. My other bridesmaid ordered a Maya Cami Embellished Top Maxi in size 8. She received a long sleeve sequined gown. We contacted customer service who said they’d let us know in 10 days. She went ahead and returned it and ordered the correct dress AGAIN, in a 6. She received the dress in good time but it was completely destroyed. Looked like someone picked all the beading off. Neither of them have gotten their refunds, as of yet, and are out $300 between the two of them. We’ve been forced to find different dresses in a short amount of time and have really been put in a bad position. There’s no contact number for the US and customer service literally does NOTHING. I do not recommend this company and feel like I’ve been scammed.

            Used ASOS for about 10 years. Ordered a gorgeous embellished bodysuit in a size 8. It arrived and went to try it on and it was a size 6 - guess what? They'd ran out of stock so I couldn't get the correct size - was livid! It was a very long winded customer service conversation before telling me to just return it and get a refund, no voucher or anything to compensate - I find that pretty poor as it does make you think twice about bothering with them, they must not care about customer retention because they're so big.

            Asos is a good business but they have got to stop using hermes for deliveries. It is nothing but disappointment when i find out my order will be sent through hermes. I placed an order on 12th August.  Rather early during the day which was meant to be a gift on the following day. Did not receive the hourly slot during the day and i was concerned it wont arrive. Chat to asos customer service and they said it should come betwren 7am and 10pm. However i knew this wont happen knowing hermes bad service. As predicted the item did not arrive and i was not pleased. Then the next day i got the delivery slot for between 11 am and 1pm and the parcel only got delivered at 5pm. I do not know why hermes is a functioning company still.  Their service is bad and it reflects bad on companies that use them.

            Really bad experience. I was due to receive my order on 3rd August (paid for next day delivery) and that was confirmed via the usual text and email. It didn't arrive and when I sent an email query I received a response to say it would be with me by 9th August or before. It didn't arrive so I sent another email mail to receive one back saying they couldn't access the information so they would get back to me within 48 hours...I then called them to be told that as the tracking information did not go past the 2 August they could re-order or refund. I elected to re-order. I then received another email to say they've passed it to their specialist team and I would get a response in 12 days!?!I contacted them again to ask if they had re- ordered as advised on the phone, to be told no, and that they'd let me know when they had an update. I have now asked for a refund and we shall see how long that takes. Quite staggering from a big company in this day and age.It's a real shame as I like their stuff, but this is appalling customer service that has destroyed my confidence in purchasing anything else in future (I've used them several times and paid for premium delivery). I accept things sometimes get lost, but the timelines for responses (48 hours, 12 days) and the lack of any real reasoning is terrible in my view.Update:Package now received (it was in fact re-ordered?!). Hopefully it won't happen again...

            True story.Ordered 3 pairs of limited edition Nike trainers to the value of £300.They came in a torn plastic mailing bag and my limited edition trainers obviously suffered damage along the way.Then I find that ASOS send me incomplete items. One shoebox is replaced with a generic one and the other is missing official Nike lining paper, and bearing in mind the damaged boxes in the first place.Clearly I'm angry and disappointed so phone customer service and my opinion of ASOS goes downhill rapidly after that. The point is it doesn't matter if they advertise a product and send you something incomplete and broken. They don't care, they scream apologies but in reality it's about money/profit over your value as a customer. They feed you lies over lies, cut and paste generic responses and when you do actually get a response, it completely contradicts what the last person has said. It's almost they unconsciously forget about our valued custom and think about their profit margins instead.I have been passed from pillar to post and got nowhere in regards to my damaged and incomplete products. No compensation, no partial refund, but a condescending 10% off any future purchases if I still value ASOS in high regard. If you worry about where you stand on damaged and incomplete items, ASOS won't be doing you, or anyone else any favours.

Seems like a good deal at the time but you never get your order next day as they use Hermes who couldn’t organise a bun fight in a bakery! Customer service is rude and unhelpful. Don’t solve any queries. Don’t let you cancel orders when you don’t receive them on time. They expect you to wait for a week for your NEXT DAY DELIVERY parcel.

            Don’t get me wrong, i love asos, but i’m so disappointed in my recent order. I purchased £10 triangle earrings and i was so excited to get them. They arrive and they’re around the size of a 10p coin, they don’t go through the ear, they’re easily bendable/breakable and they don’t have a secure clip (no butterfly back or anything). I’m quite annoyed to be honest and i can’t even get a refund.

            This company provides beyond the worst level of customer service that I have EVER received. They will mess up on your shipment and provide no refund or legitimate explanation for the issue aside from asking that you just wait and follow-up with them even after 7 after refusing to allow you to speak with management to address your concerns. I've had multiple issues with asos in regards to their fraudulent shipping notices and poor customer service.

            I must say, after having been with ASOS for 7 years and never having an issue I am now not sure at all if I will order again. Bought an outfit I needed for Friday on Monday and as a Premier Delivery member was eligible for Next Day delivery. Nothing has been delivered to me, the customer care are quite rude, closed the chat on me without even apologizing because ""there is nothing more they can help with"" and won't even provide an update on redelivery saying ""once we know more we will be in touch"". They also won't cancel my order or refund me the money - I can only wait for this to someday get to me. I am now out of pocket AND have nothing to wear. It wouldn't be a big drama otherwise, but I am pregnant and putting together a maternity outfit can be quite tricky with normal clothes, especially in the bottoms department. So overall just really not a very good service. Will be trying Silkfred!

            I shop with ASOS a few times a month and I've had Premium Delivery for the past couple of years. I've never had an issue with them, delivery has always been on time and the items are always good quality. The few faulty items I have received have either been replaced very quickly, or a refund was sent to me promptly. Their customer service is good and they don;t take long to reply by email. Would definitely recommend!

            Iv never  had a totally successful clothes shop with ASOS.I find there products yes, good quality however I do find them to be slightly misleading and inaccurate to their online site. With places like YouTube and blogs raving about the site i decided to give it a go and found none of what I had ordered fit even though it was my regular size and I bought a variety of different styles. The bikini I ordered was a horrible non stretchy material that did nothing to flatter my body and looked hideous nothing like I had seen online.The pricing can be really overboard you can definitely find a better cheaper alternative shop.Yes their range is great with many many items and brands to choose from and it is true you will always find something you like but definitely do your research before: measuring your body etc and ALWAYS check materials used.I have had a couple of positive experiences with this brand there swimming costumes are great last a long time and have great style and current fashions available.Even with a few negative experiences I will shop with ASOS again as there range is really impressive and caters for almost everybody.

            I personally do not have an experience, however I do have a friend who whilst living in the UK had a premium account with Asos and was a pretty good customer of Asos. She went to Nigeria and made orders worth £400 from Asos as she trusted that they will deliver the items to Nigeria only for Asos to keep making excuses and eventually decide to block her account after taking the money from her account and not even delivering anything to her. Blocking her account whilst she was trying to find out what was going on is totally unacceptable. If they can't keep the terms of sales, then the money should be refunded in full. I normally do not shop from Asos, but this definitely is a complete put-off. I certainly would not want to be treated in this manner, £400 is no joke. If they can't do international deliveries or they do not trust orders form foreign countries, it's simple, DO NOT ACCEPT SUCH ORDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE instead of taking the money so quick and failing to fulfill your part.

When I posted on to their wall they told me they had been too busy to resolve it and someone would get back to me. Surprise surprise no one did. I ended up opening a case with PayPal and resolving it with them. PayPal were very helpful and said they couldn’t understand why ASOS didn’t just refund the charge.

            STAY AWAY FROM ASOS!Been shopping with ASOS for years now but recently it seems like they went from being one of my favourite online shops to one of the worst I've ever dealt with. I placed an order and within an hour of doing so, my credit card was charged. Which was fine, except I didn't receive a confirmation email that my order was placed. Waited another day, still no email. I contacted them via chat and they said they can't find my order and they would pass it along to their specialist team to look further into this matter and that they would get back to me within 48 hours. 48 hours came and STILL NO WORD. I emailed them, nothing. I reached out via Twitter and it seems like it's a different person on there every half hour because they kept asking me again and again for the same information, and that they can't find my order. Then they replied and said they looked into it and the reason they can't find my order is because my credit card declined the purchase. UTTER GARBAGE, as prior to contacting them, I contacted my bank to confirm if the purchase went through, and it did!! So ASOS just flat out lied to me! I tweeted them again to say this THEN THEY THREATENED TO BLOCK ME. Geezuz. Still no word if they're planning to refund me. Can't believe they've turned into scamming thieves, but that's the truth.

            I've bought countless items from ASOS, an when everything goes according to plan it's fine, but when it doesn't they're just rubbish and they don't care that they are.On one occasion, I had a pair of chinos sent to me, and I got en email from Royal Mail telling me the item had been delivered when it had not. When I informed ASOS they were unwilling to do anything until I contacted my local sorting office and carried out my own investigation as to what had happened. I had to go through all the drama of waiting on hold with a Royal Mail contact centre, being transferred around etc. I think this should really be something ASOS should do themselves but they unapologetically demand the customer does it. To the point they told me I should physically go to my sorting office before contacting them again.On a more recent occasion my item broke, and rather than replace it, they just refunded it by accident. When I pointed out that I couldn't just re-order it because the price had increased plus I'd have to pay for delivery again, they didn't really care at all.There have been other instances too, but I've chosen the most recent and most unreasonable.

            My order was to be delivered the next day by DPD. They messed up my delivery and eventually delivered it to my local Sainsbury's without any notification. ASOS were extremely unhelpful in helping me locate my parcel via their messaging system and kept sending me automated messages saying my parcel had been signed for by someone named John. Eventually I spoke to ASOS via their helpline and they gave me a reference number with which to retrieve my parcel. The customer service advisor was monotone and twice put me on hold without telling me he was going to do so. When I got to Sainsbury's a day later I was asked for a barcode not the reference number and told to return with photographic ID and a utility bill. I asked if my parcel was actually there as ASOS has proven to be unreliable and I was told they did not have it. If I had not asked I would have made a return trip for no reason and when I later checked my email, I already had a refund making it unlikely my parcel was even still at Sainsbury's when I was given my reference number. Bad customer service and no communication.

I contacted them the day my dress was ""guaranteed"" to arrive and didnt hear back from them for 3 days in which they said ""your order has now arrived!"" Yay. Good job stating the obvious. I want an apology at least. Well turns out the dress was a completely different one than was ordered and the shirt was in the wrong size. After contacting them again they said I should hear back from someone in 10 days. 10 days... really? Ill be returning everything today. Goodbye ASOS

            I've always ordered from ASOS, but lately there is pretty late shipping (or lost) and bad customer service, they can't assist at all. The customer service end the conversation while I was typing about the delivery problem. There is no tracking number to track the order, and the solution is ""they will look for it"" , ""pls allow to wait for another month to be arrived due to shipment delayed"", or "" re-order then the original arrive you can return "" . If re-order ,Customer have to pay again and return the parcel which shipping fee have to paid by customer . Is it good solution for customer which let customer pay more and more ? Such disappointed!!!Customer supposed to get the parcel on arrival date as stated when they order. If your shipping don't have tracking number please let customer know before order, so they can decide whether they still order or not !!! Feel like cheated by ASOS ....Do not comment on ASOS FB page about bad side .They hide some bad comment !!Contact to ASOS via FACEBOOK and ASOS CF but they just let me keep waiting waiting.....Dose anyone have any solution if the parcel has been lost from ASOS ? Because they act like not responsible for it !!!!

            Placed an order a week ago for delivery on the 4th. Contacted them on 'Chat' prior to the supposed delivery asking why it hadn't been dispatched, I was told the usual that I couldn't do anything until after 10pm on the proposed delivery date....surprise, surprise my order didn't arrive. Contacted them again and now told that it will be with me by the 14th????? I go on holiday on the 10th and placed the order well in advance that other more competent companies could fullfil the order in time. I have asked to cancel the order which they won't do. so I'm out of pocket for an order that may or may not arrive. I'm having to shop elsewhere so that I can guarantee that I've the clothes for my holiday.Absolute shambles of a company that I will no longer be using.

            I placed an order on the 30th of July and received an email to say it would be delivered on or before 4th of August. There was no sign of a dispatch email so I got in touch with ASOS on FOUR different occasions but apparently they weren't able to tell me where my parcel was or whether it had even been dispatched. Instead, I had to wait until 10pm on the 4th of August to definitely make sure my parcel wasn't being delivered, despite it not actually being dispatched.I've contacted them again to ask what's going on and my delivery date is now the 14th of August, two weeks after the day I placed the order and after my holiday that I ordered for.Every time I have contacted ASOS for help I have had a copy and paste answer, saying the exact same thing. They will not cancel or refund my order, I have to wait until it arrives and return it for a refund.Complete shambles, they suggest I place the order again and pay for next day delivery but I've taken my money to boohoo - I ordered last night and it's already on it's way.

            1 star and to be honest I’d give none if that would be only possible. Customer service? There’s no such a thing in ASOS. Sent 3 emails to find out what’s happening with my order which supposed to come in yesterday - no reply ! Spoke to someone on customer care chat just to be told I need to wait another 10 more days and there’s no option to cancel my order and get a refund. No word of apologies I’ve been rudely disconnected of the chat. Please before you place an order with ASOS do check the opinion of other customers as 3.5 stars out of 10 only proves I should have been smarter and never place any order with them! Don’t make the same mistake!

            Have always been happy with all of my purchases from Asos, I have made problem-free returns and the customer service is really friendly. The website has a good structure and layout, it's easy to overlook and not messy. I'm not giving Asos a 5 because of their prizes. When I started shopping on Asos you could make bargains, like really good bargains, but now most of the items are quite expensive and some items even overpriced.

            I am absolutely furious with asos. I ordered some items on 30th July for my dads birthday thinking asos are usually bang on with deliveries as they usually are. I checked everyday on the app and it told me they were to be delivered Saturday 4th August - fine happy with that. Just to be sure as the birthday was that day I contacted asos live chat for them to reassure me that even though no had no tracking or email the order would be with me before 10pm - again fine. I was reassured I would receive an email in a few hours to confirm. No email, no delivery. I contacted again this morning via twitter and have been told there has been delays and they are unable to deliver until on or before 15th August. ARE YOU JOKING? Why have I repeatedly been lied to? So far I have contacted the company 5 times and I am still non the wiser as to what the truth is or what is going on. Will be thinking twice before ordering anything again!!!

I've made a complaint and asked what the actual problem is and they've said there's a carrier issue. No compensation or anything and have told me that it should be with me by the 14th... just 3 days before my holiday. May not have any shoes worn in for comfort for my holidays. Absolute joke.

            Asked for an exchange, they give me a refund and put the prices up. I message them on Twitter to give them the benefit of the doubt to resolved, 4 days later, I’ve had no reply yet they are replying to people who posted 5 minutes ago. I send the CEO an email, no reply. I contact them on their live chat, they end the conversation without telling me. I message them again and ask to speak to a manager, they refuse. I ask for their managers name, they refuse. They have the nerve to tell me they have waivered the charge of the items and therefore they had done me a favour! It’s taken 4 days for me to get someone to acknowledge me and they didn’t even confirm they had refunded it! Simply told me I had to wait and they would sort it another time because they are busy?! I tell them I will take this further, they end the chat and refer me to their customer care page on their website! The absolute incompetency of the whole company is beyond belief. If I ever treated a customer this way, I would be out of a job! They are useless! Don’t bother with them! Save your money for a company who cares about its customer!

            I ordered over £100 worth of items from ASOS on Sunday the 29th of July for my holiday that I will be going to on the 7th Augus. Now before making the order I thought to myself is it worth getting next day delivery? But as I got through the end of the ordering process ASOS said that my order will be with me by Friday the 3rd of August, so ASOS being a uk based company and me living in the uk I thought this would not be a problem at all. So it got to Friday and I looked at the order to try and track it and find that they have only just shipped it off to the post office. It’s now Sunday and I’ve looked on the tracking service again and it’s still not arrived at the post office? Has the van driver got lost?? Customer service has been no help what so ever and didn’t take any notice when I was saying that I needed my items before the 7th of August. They have created a massive incovinece for me that could have been avoided by giving me a accurate delivery date as I would have been more than happy to pay for next day delivery!

            The service of overseas delivery is so bad. It is my second time to have the same problem for late delivery and the asos service in facebook is not helpful and they only replied after a day. What I asked is that I have the select the delivery type no matter I choose standard delivery or express delivery? I don’t understand why the order cannot deliver to the address I have already filled in when I checked out but I have to select the delivery type again through a sms from the Skynet with unclear instructions.Moreover, the asos staff told me I missed the time frame for delivery and I have to contact the the carrier myself. Hello? It should be the responsibility for the carrier to contact with customer to make sure the delivery on time. How come I have to contact them myself for every delivery? I supposed what I need to do is only waiting for the order arrive in the address I have already filled in. The sms message should be only for giving a notice for the delivery status or if customer want to change to delivery way. It is not necessary for any further option and please just deliver to the address, it supposes a simple task......Before the above 2 times worst experience, the carrier would just gave a call to me to check the if there a changes of the delivery address. It’s absolutely so much more efficient and quicker delivery even I chosen the standard delivery. I wonder what happened to the delivery arrangement now and keep let me disappointed for the delay issues. And the online Facebook service never solve the problem of delivery which is not gonna be helpful and just wasted my time.

            I have  used ASOS a number of times and I find increasingly that their customer service skills are extremely lacking. After ordering a parcel 5 days ago that should arrive on or before today, I eventually receive an email at 15:02 today stating my that my order has been despatched. Not one of the supposed customer service advisors on the chat can explain this and you are left going round in circles with them stating ""your parcel will arrive today and we cannot investigate until 10pm"". It seems too much of a coincidence that while I'm on a chat to chase up the parcel that I suddenly receive a despatch notice and a tracking number. A tracking number which has no details yet and therefore hasn't even reached royal mail.  Come on ASOS provide some customer service training and don't fob off your customers when you have made an error and not despatched parcels. You were quick enough to take my money!

            Order for something to be arranged to be delivered yesterday, been told that it will come by 10pm. 24hrs later, I am still waiting for this order. Instead I get and email saying it will come 4 days later. Ridiculous. What annoys me more is that the item is even out of stock so I cannot even reorder it, the only thing I’ve been given is a one time 15% off on full price items which expires in 30days, it is silly because I go on ASOS now for a summer sale, not to buy full priced stuff. Anyways, I now have to wait for the item to be returned, which I did not ask for, and Hunt every day, so that it doesn’t get sold to someone else. Otherwise 16 days from now, I will get a refund, I did not find anything great with their communication and their discount will not do wonders for me. I am still a pretty dress down and money down

            I ordered a Ted Baker dress that I had been searching for for months.  They sent the wrong size so I contacted customer service to request an exchange.  Instead they refunded my money and said the dress is out of stock.  The problem is, I would rather have kept the wrong size they sent than not have it at all, so I asked if they could cancel the refund because I wanted to keep it.  They said they can’t and that I have to return the dress even though I can’t purchase another in the correct size.  It was a terrible experience because I feel I’m an honest person and would like to pay for the dress.  So now they’re out $130, because I’m not returning it.  All they had to do to prevent this situation was inform me the dress is out of stock and ask if I would like a refund or if I would like to keep the dress, but I guess that’s asking too much of them.

            ASOS is all well and good until your delivery doesn't go smoothly, at which point the company is unable to effectively liaise with its designated delivery companies. For a next day delivery the best they can do is tell you they will get back to you with information in 48 hours. There really is no customer care.

            I wasn't sceptical of this site so I purchased an item for $144.84 NZD... Then I read the reviews and began to fret because the majority are so negative. Fortunately for me I received the item I paid for in the timeframe they outlined - 7 days in total. I ordered on 27/07/18, it went through the delivery process and landed in NZ on the 31st (customs processes), then through to the company that's contracted to deliver it to me. The beauty of it all is I got to see in real time where the package was, and I was able to speak to the courier company about any delays... that put me at ease.All-in-all a great experience, which means I am happy to make further purchases from this site given the quality of the item and the turn around time in delivery. So thank you ASOS for the awesome experience.

            ASOS...obviously stands for Always Short On Service!!!  Really shoddy customer care. Ordered goods for delivery within 5 days and was told day later that delivery would be delayed by a day. As I needed the items for a festival I was going to I asked ASOS to just cancel the order as it wasn’t going to arrive in time.  It then took them 2 days to respond saying it’s passed the cancellation point and that if I want a refund then I need to return the items once they arrive.  I then received a separate mail saying the delivery was going to be delayed by a further 3 days.  Nothing short of ridiculous and I will not be using ASOS again.  If goods aren’t going to arrive as per their own dates for delivery then they should just cancel the order and not expect customers to return them at the customers own expense and inconvenience.  Save your money guys and head to the high street where you aren’t reliant on these idiots.

            Second time in the past two months where I have ordered a dress and been sent the wrong item. Paid for express shipping this time, hoping to have item by the weekend but clearly that's not going to happen. When I contacted customer service I was advised it will be TEN DAYS before someone will come back to me. Are you serious? Ten days. I was told they are extremely busy at the moment...maybe that's because you keep sending people the wrong thing? Ridiculous.Update: I followed up today and according to the girl who helped me the person I spoke with last week never even raised it with the specialist team. So now I have to wait another 10 days.

I emailed asos straight away about the problem and it took them 3 days to get back to me and now that they finally have replied all it said was it can take upto 10days for an outcome. So in the meantime i’m out of pocket, have no bag and i’m stuck with a pair of black boots that i never ordered! Fair to say i won’t be shopping here AGAIN!

            Bought some trainers, received the payment confirmation in a few minutes. After 3 days I received an email that the item is out of stock. And that I have to wait from 5-10 day for the refund. So basically they've tricked me. Also they used my money for this period. I don't think this is fair or legal, to present something for sale (something that you don't possess) and take money from people like that. Thank you ASOS.com. Worst experience, never will recommend. Altough they present products in a glamourous way it will cause a headache after you order ... your expectations will be betrayed. AVOID!

            It’s been way over a month and I still haven’t received my order. I made my order on the 17th of June and now we are in August and there’s no sign of it.I’ve tried emailing to find out what the way forward is and if I’ll be getting a refund or some remedying of the situation and they aren’t responding. They asked me to wait 3 weeks after the set delivery date in July and now it’s gone and past. They also have this set template about checking with neighbours and the post office which I have done to no avail.The customer service has been appalling, I needed the items for a special occasion and they didn’t keep their end of the deal which has been extremely disappointing. What’s even more disappointing is the lack of accountability prevalent in how they are handling the situation. This has really tainted my views about them and their brand. Why promise things to your customers when you can’t deliver? I’ve lost out on money that I could’ve used for something else.

            Easy to place an order. But returning and getting a refund is like trying to pull teeth out of a crocodile.First I'm told my item hasn't arrived back. When I corrected the customer services robot and told her it was in their warehouse the story changed. Glad I returned it tracked. They received it on the 23rd. Was told if I'm not refunded by the 7th August to let them know. I'm still waiting. They've sent a refund email but so far no money. Really disappointed.

            What a disgusting and deceitful way to do business! Ordered on 25th July...supposed to be delivered on 30th july between 5-9pm. Waited in by the front room window so would not miss delivery. No delivery at all went to bed at 10.30pmChecked the tracking next morning to find an update saying ""delivery attempted"" redelivery for 24 hours.I was super shocked as I knew this was a complete lie.Checked tracker again on 31st july to find a message saying "" delivery today (31st) between 5-9pm.On my way home i call customer service at asoz and vent my anger and explain the the delivery operative has lied znd not attempted delivery at all. She acted like she was unbothered. I asked her to contact Myhermes to see what was happening she informed me she had no contact details for them and that she had checked the system and it showed ""  unable to access the propery!!!! I live on an open street in a house with a front door accessable to anyone!She then told me that until 3 attempts had been made to deliver i could not get a refund and advised me to wait for the 5-9pm slot and see.It is now the second evening of waiting at the front room window for a scheduled promised delivery and it is now 9.10pm and no delivery.

            I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. ASOS offer premier delivery and I've got a year of free next day for only £10. If there are delays they put updates on their help page straight away and they've always helped me out. I've never had an issue and I buy from there regularly. Their returns are free and they have heaps of different ways to do so - def think there is some poor reviews (but then again people expect too much these days). Great company!

            The customer service at ASOS in the UK has always been great. However, since I have moved to Germany I think the German ASOS have a massive problem. The customer service is so atrocious, insulting and confusing that I will never use them again. Not only did they tell me that i was in the wrong (when i wasn't), they only replied to my email 2.5 weeks after it was sent! Finally I managed to get them to actually read my emails and respond. It is such a shame that a company that I relied on in the UK I can no longer do in Germany.

            TLDR: Item order > Item lost in courier depot > ASOS does absolutely nothing to reconcile the situation. So I've been a serious ASOS customer for 3 years now. I've purchased so much from them that my ASOS A-list says I'm levelled at a VVIP. I know, embarrassing. For starters the next delivery for under £10/year is awesome, the selection is great and I loved getting little vouchers from points I'd accrued. Most of the time everything is flawless.But duuuuuude as soon as something goes wrong regarding delivery/ return or anything where you need the help of an actual human to solve a problem, it all goes out the window.I've contacted them literally 6 times over the past month as an order of mine had clearly been lost by the courier. When I track the parcel via Hermes, the last update is from 11/07/2018 which says ""On its way to the courier"". Obviously it has been lost, fine totally get that happens. What really sucks is that instead of ASOS amending the issue by issuing a replacement order they just keep me hanging ensuring the ""specialist team"" is handling it. All the while my item is now out of stock.  -_-I know as a business they are killin it, so I don't understand why they have given such little thought and care to their customer care department.All in all super bummed and my order issue remains unsolved.

            This is the communication that I have had with Asos live Chat over eight different chats.  I have made a purchase with Asos  on Friday 27 July and was charged via PayPal and on my credit card.  However when I go to My Orders in my Asos there are no current orders under my account.  I have contacted PayPal to raise a dispute but due to the transaction being pending I am unable to raise this transaction to a dispute.   This transaction will always remain pending because Asos has no record of the order.  I have spoken to Paypal five times now and they have sent me the invoice number that asos sent them: P-5Gxwg-yq66h-uvm2m-3hj66-ass6a.  This is the eight online chat I have had with you at Asos and lI was told on Saturday to wait until Sunday and the transaction would be removed.  I have followed your instructions and the transactions is still pending in my PayPal account and my credit card has been charged despite you having a business day to correct your error.  I expect your organisation to cancel this transaction immediately as I have followed all of your recommendations since the 27th.  I am unable to take any action with the dispute resolution service within PayPal because the transaction is pending.  Unless you fix the issue at your end and send a directive to PayPal to remove this transaction it will remain pending. My chat reference is 14720775 and I will not take the response of ""wait another 24 hours for the transaction to be fixed.""  If you cannot help me immediately I expect, NO DEMAND that you connect me to a supervisor to solve this issue as what you are doing is nothing short of theft. After this chat I was told that the issue was being looked into and that I could get a copy of the chat if I needed it.  They will not fix the problem and will not give me a timeframe for it being solved.  This organisation is pathetic morally bankrupt and has the most pathetic customer service.  I have only one bigger regret and that is that I cannot give them a 0 or negative rating.

            Stay clear at this company at all the costs. They will promise you a delivery and then fail to meet it. When you contact them to chase they will tell you to wait 10 days.

            I bought few items from ASOS and they sent me the wrong sizes for most of the items including the shoes. Their clothes look very appealing on the internet  but The material looks very cheap in person. I had a big embarrassed moment when a shirt that i bought from ASOS ripped on both side of my body. It was an embarrassing moment to go through as i noticed later during the day and it was probably ripped since i arrived at work. I paid $45 for the shirt to ripped at first wear. I won't order again from their site since i see i'm not the only one complaining about their clothes, delivery and customers service.

            I would STRONGLY advise people to steer very clear of ASOS if you would like to receive your item or at very least, keep your money secure. I ordered a very expensive item on the 23rd July this year, as a birthday present for my sister, the date of which is fast approaching. Hermes was used to deliver the item (first mistake on ASOS's part as this company is notoriously awful). I expected the delivery yesterday afternoon, which I waited in for. It didn't arrive so I checked the tracking details. I noticed, very oddly, that the driver had requested a return to sender before even attempting delivery. I can only assume he/she was running late on their day's deliveries so just thought 'ah well, scrap that one, save a bit of time'. The item was then apparently sent back to ASOS without even letting me know.I contacted ASOS about this matter, explaining that obviously, this is not my fault as I was in the house all day and no delivery attempt was even made. They then told me (via clearly scripted messages) that I would have to wait 12 days or more for them to get the item back and then refund my money or resend it. This is completely unacceptable as I have had my money taken (and not a small amount either) through NO fault of my own! They are now just saying they refuse to do anything to help me and to top it all, cut me off on the chat, saying 'I can't help you, so I'm going now'. I've never known customer service quite this shocking EVER. I get that the problem may lie mostly with Hermes' lazy delivery drivers, however, it was not my choice nor knowledge to use Hermes, so I expected at the very least, for ASOS to say 'okay so this isn't your fault, so we will round you immediately and take this up with Hermes'. But instead, I just get fobbed off. Luckily (the only saving grace here) I paid via PayPal who have listened, taken my side of the argument and opened a case for me and have taken the money back from PayPal (up yours ASOS! :D) but obviously I do have to wait a few days before I will get it back.Just say clear of this cowboy company people :)

            So I ordered a few items the 29 of June, and unfortunately it didn’t suit me, so I returned two of the three items. I sent it back the 8th of july, and do to the tracking numbers I could see that ASOS received it the 10th of July. The 21 july, I reached out to customerservice on Facebook. I hadn’t received a confirmation from ASOS about them reciving my order. I was told that It could take up till 11 working days, so if I still haven’t heard from them the 25 july ad midnight I should contackt them again. The 26 july I reached out again. And first person I had contact with was Aaron. He told me to wait. But I will not wait any longer, and referred to what the first ASOS employee told me, and told Aaron that due to the tracking number I could see that they have received it! And then I was in contact with Luke, Hazz, and Maya, they asked for the same things: tracking number and order number - I sent pictures twice and third time, I told Maya, to read the conversation and that she would fine everything she needed to know further up. Then Rebecca replied, saying she would send my problem to the “specialist” team. And that I now need to wait 10 more days for this “team” to handle my case.... Im so tired and unsatisfied! This way of customer service is not okay!

            Asos is fine until something goes wrong and then you have to rely on the most appalling level of customer service I have ever seen. I have (or rather had) an account with Asos set up with £9.95 next day delivery and ordered some items to my workplace I absolutely had to have for the weekend. Nothing turned up that day and I then got a text to say that I had requested a change of date and my items would be turning up at my office on Saturday - I don’t work on a Saturday, so this was of no use to me!I called DPD in regards to the delivery who told me that Asos had requested this change and to contact them. When I contacted Asos they were entirely unhelpful and told me I had to deal directly with DPD and change the delivery location myself. I went back to DPD who told me that Asos have a lock on changing the delivery address and therefore I had to speak to them. When I returned to the online chat with Asos, the customer service rep (that’s you, “Charlotte”) abruptly terminated the conversation with me!I then started a new chat where it was finally established that you Asos won’t allow you to change the location of the order other to click and collect at a shop in the vicinity of the original delivery location - absolutely useless!I had no choice but to cancel the order and order a new one to my house for the next day (Asos refused to guarantee they could get it for the morning so I had to take a risk). This also meant I was £400 down at this point with nothing to show for it.Then on the Saturday I received a further text from DPD to tell me they had tried to deliver my order to my workplace on Saturday and I wasn’t in, so they were going to try again on Monday. I contacted Asos to find out what the status was and the customer service couldn’t tell me. *sigh* so used to this level of incompetence at this point, I just said to them, fine, just deliver it and I’ll return it.The order didn’t turn up and Dpd told me they had no idea what was happening - you’ll find this is the general vibe of the entire operation - so I just gave up at this point and thought I’ll wait and see what happens.I finally get an email to say they’ve received my order back and I will get a refund in 5 - 10 working days - hooray! When I tried to log into Asos to check the status...would you believe it, as a final thank you, they’ve blocked my account - no explantation, no opportunity to contact them, just blocked.I don’t wish to use their miserable company again, but they should allow me the opportunity to properly terminate my account (remove card details etc) and confirm to me they are no longer charging me an annual £9.95 for next day delivery - otherwise seems a bit crookish to me - I have found the whole experience beyond awful and would highly recommend people use this company sparingly until their customer service is properly up and running.

            I have ordered from Asos since 2016, and the first couple of times, I received my orders with no issues. However, my last order did not reach me and when I contacted them they said they have resend the package. Its been over 2 months now and I have not received the replacement package. I contacted customer service again highlighting the issue and demanded a refund. They claimed they have forwarded my issue to a ""specialist team"" to deal with. No reply from them since then despite me sending them various emails and speaking to customer service. I doubt I'll be getting my money back and I will never purchase anything again from such a shady company.

            I have contacted Asos customer support for helping me with a refund that I did not receive. They did not issue a refund and told me I should wait (although I've been waiting for over a month). The worst part is that when I asked to talk to a manager, the chat representative said there is no more information they could provide and ENDED the chat. Being a customer for the last few years, I really feel that recently customer support is lacking on Asos part and I shall definitely think again before ordering anything.

            I recently made a purchase from ASOS for some things I needed for the following week. I put the order through with Paypal and an error occurred with a message explaining that my order and payment did not go through. I tried again twice more with no success. I decided to check my e-mail and bank account to confirm that it was unsuccessful. My order was not confirmed with ASOS but 3 payments had been taken out of my spendings account leaving me with less than enough to even pay my phone bill this week (I ended up overdrawn once that payment came out). I contacted them immediately on Facebook and was told that due to a technical error on their website none of my order attempts were successful and that it would take 48 hours to sort out a refund and 5-10 working days to send me my money back. I've been offered no reconciliation and I have had to take money out of my savings account (I am lucky that I have some savings) in order to pay for food and petrol while I wait for my money to be returned to me. On top of this, I will not have the items I ordered for next week. I am frustrated, disappointed and anxious - it is unlikely I will ever be purchasing from them again.

            I am from Malaysia.I was a happy customer with ASOS since 2017...until recently it changed my mind 180°.Like others, i made an order on 28 May, they sent the parcel using an untrackable courier service, it didn't reach me at all, estimated date given was long overdue.Wrote to them many times(the replies were from different person everytime), the solutions they gave were useless. Nobody would ever go to postal service to check parcel using their name or order#!!They said they had passed my case to specialist team and asked me to wait for another 17 days. Didnt reply my tweet. The livechat achieved nothing.Received a message a week ago from FB messenger saying they had sent a replacement order..... VIA THE SAME UNTRACKABLE COURIER SERVICE AGAIN!! this is just beyond my bewilderment!! Seriously i dont think my order will ever reach me.I like ASOS products, but i don't think i will ever buy from it again.

            I ordered things from ASOS a few times. The first couple of times were ok, I got refund from them shortly after I sent the items back. It seems everyone on Youtube is ordering things from ASOS, and they seem to have good experience with them, which made me trust ASOS. Recently, I made another order. One of the items was not sent to me correctly and other items didn't fit me well, so I sent most of the items back to them. It's been two months and I still haven't got my refund. I've contacted them many many times, but the issue was just not resolved. I will never buy things from them again.

            Order is now over 2 weeks late for delivery despite me paying for next day delivery. When I got in touch with them I was told I could not report it late for 7 days. I waited 7 days and then asked again where it was. I was told my query had been passed to a ""specialist team"" and that they would get in touch in 3 days. I waited 3 days and followed up again. I am then told their was an error and they could not look into it and that it would be passed to the ""specialist team"" again and that this would take 7 days. Today is the 7th day so I got in touch again to be told they would be extremely busy and that they would get in touch at some point. The service is awful, the help chats achieve nothing and emails go unanswered. They took payment for this item the day after I ordered it but have yet to provide the item.

            I too have been a customer at Asos for years and there have been many small problems (items arrived broken, were missing or wrong). Anyway, customer service always sorted the problems out and I got my refunds, so I never complained.But this time is different: in my last delivery in the beginning of June there was one item I hadn't ordered and one that I DID order was missing. I promptly contacted customer service and they said I need to return the wrongly received item and I'd get a refund for the missing one. I returned a few other things too.2 weeks later, I got a refund for all of my returned clothes EXCEPT the missing piece that I had contacted them about.So I wrote them another mail saying that I'm missing the refund for said piece. They quickly replied that they had forwarded my request to the infamous 'Specialist team'. That was 3 weeks ago. I've contacted them again last week but have heard nothing since.This is ridiculous. Yes, mistakes can happen, but they shouldn't THIS FREQUENTLY. And why do we have to pay for THEIR mistakes?I'd also like to add that lately I'm not even getting birthday discounts, of course there have never been gift codes or any kind of compensation for their mistakes in the past(apart from delayed refunds) and in Germany there is no point system either. I don't even know why I've been ordering from them all this time.I just hope I'll get this one missing refund for a cardigan I ordered but never received and then I'll never order at Asos again.

            I've never experienced worse customer service. I was sent the wrong item and by the time I went to exchange it, my size was out of stock. Not to mention my shipment had been delayed. All I got was a ""sorry"" and was told ASOS does not offer discount codes or compensation for these types of mistakes, even if the mistakes are their fault! I then (stupidly) made another order just a few days later, and this shipment was also delayed! I qualified for 2-day shipping both times by spending a good amount of money, and neither time they delivered on that. What's so frustrating is that there is no phone number to talk to anyone live. I was again told via their chat system that they can't do anything and that they were ""sorry."" I complained and the woman ended the chat - rude and unprofessional. I'm wildly disappointed because I was a loyal customer and really enjoyed their clothing. Won't be buying from them ever again.

            The customer service replies quickly with canned responses and unable to take any action regarding their delivery other than to say ‘that they are working hard but you need to wait until the 31st’. They say that because of their internal procedure they cannot contact the courier (what makes no sense since any company of this size has a proper account with their courier and a service line in order to enquiry further regarding their parcels and also raising an investigation). They don’t offer any help. Will start a complain through the EU commission to see if they finally start to have some responsibility for their actions. For anyone interest in escalating the issue through the EU just google it for ‘online dispute resolution’ , just sharing the tip as I saw I’m not the only one with this issue.

            I initially placed an order a few weeks back and when I was notified that the parcel would be delivered (by the courier Hermes) I stayed at home all morning waiting for the delivery.  No delivery attempt was made.  The same thing happened for the next two days and after the third non existent delivery attempt my parcel was returned to asos.  I was told the only thing I could do was to reorder the item.  So I placed an order on Sunday 15th July and expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday in line with The Asos standard delivery within 3 working days.  The money was taken from my account on Tuesday 17th however no package arrived on the Wednesday and no one contacted me to tell me why.  By Friday I had still received nothing and still not been contacted by asos, so it was left to me to contact them.  The response I received was just a stock reply that told me that the courier was delayed and I’d now have to wait until the 31st July for my package and ASOS would do nothing until then.  I am now waiting....Terrible experience and terrible customer service with asos so far... surely asos need to consider changing the couriers they use!Update as of 1st August.  My parcel never arrived.  ASOS have done nothing but tell me to wait, which I have done and I am now left with nothing.

            Delivery was ""left in my porch"" but nowhere to be seen when I returned home. Spoken to a customer service agent who told me he would pass this onto the ""specialist team"" and that they would be in touch within 72 hours. 72 hours later... nothing. I contacted them again for them to tell me to allow a further 24 hours as they are busier than expected. 24 hours later... nothing. I contacted them again, for them to tell me this has not yet been passed on and that this will be sent over immediately... I will need to wait another 72 hours. Do yourselves a favour and go elsewhere.

            Asos delivery is ridiculous, ‘estimated date’ is completely made up, I called Hermes to say it will take at least another three working days from their office. I have premium delivery but my parcel won’t reach me for a week? rip off totally put off by their rubbish service.

            Wow! i wish i had looked i to reviews before i used them! Ordered 3 bridesmaid dresses, thinking they look lovely and at £65 each was very happy! Overlooked the fact they came in a tiny bag and looked so creased! Couple of months later one of my bridesmaids lost alot of weight to needed a smaller size, as the dress had gone on sale i thought might aswell buy a new one instead of faffing with alterations when my bridesmaid lived over  3 hours away. Here's where the problem starts! My delivery date was last Wednesday it's now Saturday, on tracking it on Wednesday it says they'd tried to deliver it on monday but yet my sister (bridesmaid) was home all day and no card was left, 8.15pm on Wednesday i did a live chat with ASOS who told me i should wait until 10pm as their parcels are delivered until then, i was then told if it hadn't come to get back to them and their ""bridal team"" would help me, i told the guy hermes only deliver until 8pm. Arguing with me told me to be patient and to wait until 10pm, even sent me a tracking link where it said they deliver until 8! 10pm came and went, i then get told to wait until the 27th of July.  I ordered this dress on the 10th! And told them my wedding is T the start of August, i gave enough time to get it delivered. For days all me and my sister had in various chats, emails and messages from asos and Hermes was it will be with you in 24hours.. eventually Hermes tell me sister it has been assigned to someone who had quit their job and took it back to the depot with telling anyone, not even trying to deliver! So all this telling us to be patient when they could of looked into it! Two days later, still no dress and I've given up hope it will ever turn up. Asos have said theres nothing they can do and to just basically wait. Funny thing is this it's not just this dress, my sister also ordered something from amazon that hermes still have and Amazon have helped as much as they possibly can and have given her 30 days free prime. Asos do not value their customers at all!

            My package never arrived so I was told that I had to wait 72 hours. after 72 hours I was told that it would take 10 days. I then asked to talk to someone, and they told me they would call me the next day at 9 am... and never did, and now they're telling me that it will take 48 hours. I don't believe them and don't trust them. I've always been a loyal customer to Asos, and actually probably got over hundreds of people hooked on it because of me. I'm a social media influencer and will make sure to tell my viewers not to purchase on ASOS ever again !!!!

            I sent my parcel back to Asos over four weeks ago.  I tracked my parcel and it was located at Asos four weeks ago yesterday.  I have been in contact with over seven different live chat staff, sent a formal complaint to which I'm still awaiting a reply. I was told to wait 72 hours for a special investigation and it has now been four days.  I just done another online chat and was told that because of high demand it is still ongoing.  I have bought countless things from this website.  I have to say not one person has been able to help in anyway as it is all scripted.

            You can order from here but DO NOT RETURN unless you can ensure that you have a tracking number. On their receipts, it says to not do certified mail as their service pays for the return fees so you get it for free. DON'T DO IT AND RETURN IT CERTIFIED if you must. It has been way over 10 days since they should have received my package but it is insufficient because I do not have a tracking number. The post office tells me that ASOS is supposed to supply it because they paid for the return service and ASOS is telling me that the post office is supposed to supply it. I don't even know who's lying but according to all of the bad reviews, I would say the latter. I lost $80.

            Terrible costumer service! I order items and only half of them are delivered but they charged me for the full amount! When I complain they tell me they will look into it. How long do they say it will take??? 3 days would be fine, 5 would be annoying but whatever. No its not 5 or even 10...19 DAYS! SERIOUSLY? It is going to take you 19 days to see why you didn't deliver everything I ordered?!?! I don't care how busy you are that is COMPLETELY unacceptable! I write them to inform them that's an insane timeline for a response and hear nothing. Not even a follow up email with an explanation or apology. Just silence. I will be filing a fraud report with my bank to get the money back. Maybe when THEY come after you you'll start listening.

            I have never left a review for anyone, about anything before.I have always been really happy with the service from ASOS, until today.I was meant to receive an order yesterday from Asos delivered by Hermes including a birthday present. On the day of delivery the delivery driver chose to send my parcel back to the warehouse as it was damaged. I had no say in this matter. I was only made aware of this today when I checked the tracker of where my parcel was. I contacted Hermes who said I need to take it up with AsosAsos have said that the item will take up to 11 days to get back to them, and a further 5 days to refund me. I asked why they were refunding me on an order I still desperately needed. I was told by the agent to order the items again if I wanted them in time for the birthday. So I have had to spend X amount again to get an order sent out again... The same agent told me to get it delivered next day delivery and they will refund me. A short while after ordering again i was told that they might not be able to refund my postage.At this time I was on the verge of screaming.After ignoring my messages I decided to tweet Asos and sure enough they replied to the tweet in seconds. I’ve now been told that the order is going to take 7 days to get back to them and they will send me a replacement?????? All well and good but they’ve just made me order the whole order again.. with next day delivery.. that’s already been despatched.Each message I receive is robotic, unsympathetic and states completely different dates/times/policies.These large companies don’t care about us individuals and the money out of our pocket for their mistakes!!!!

            I've shopped with Asos for many years and they WERE fantastic.I'm not sure what has changed but recently there have been issues with the majority of my orders: 1.

Returns going missing without a refundAll EXTREMELY frustrating and time consuming.I've persevered with them but in the most recent debacle, I've been waiting for over a month for them to deal with a missing return. It has supposedly been escalated to a specialist who needs another 14 days.I will be shopping elsewhere from now on.

            I used ASOS as a favourite retail provider for years. I loved their products, prices and Premier Delivery. However, for the last few months I’ve been experiencing disappointment with every order. Even having paid for Next Day delivery, they never actually come the next day which has lead to me not having outfits for events that I ordered in time for. Orders have started to arrive with faulty items, and even missing items. Customer service advisors have become increasingly complacent, and I spoke to one today who was outright rude and unhelpful, despite my polite approach. I used to rave about ASOS, but to be honest you’d be better off avoiding purchasing from them at all.

            Update: It is now 7/30/18 and I still have not been refunded. Attempted to contact them again. They said they can't help me despite me giving them my order number! They say my order number doesn't match the info I gave and their records. Total joke. They say they will call me in 24 hours. Its been 3 days I have no one trying to contact me. I also filed a complaint with BBB and Asos.com came back and actually said I had been refunded and they emailed me. Lol. I guess the BBB doesn't require proof because that has not happened at all. I guess I am out 52.65. If I was a lawyer or had the means I would sue them. This is theft plain and simple. It has been 16 business days since I returned the items with no update on my return or refund. I guess I will have to give it 30 days before I can file a claim with my credit card company. I hate how they also require you to take a photo of your return label. I literally have no way of tracking the package since they aren't emailing me updates. I regret not doing that. Ok August 22, 2018 final update (hopefully). Eventually someone did get into contact with me. Apparently an account had been created for me however it did not have the correct email address. Apparently I created an account with a misspelled email address (one letter off). For that I take responsibility. However, because of their policies in the UK they could not assist me over this slight mistake. Even after providing my information via chat. If they had called me sooner this would have been avoided. But they took WEEKS to contact me NOT 24 hours as previously stated. The people who assisted me on the phone were helpful and accommodating. I appreciated that. Another issue was my credit card. Shortly after this event I had my card info stolen and so had to get replacement. Well ASOS refunded but it went to the old card and therefore never took place. They CLAIMED it had been processed but it had not clearly because I had no updated info to give them. Not sure why they lied about that. Anyway, after showing them both of my recent statements they agreed to refund me the return amount I was owed. In short, ASOS should improve their returns process, their customer service return time, and shouldn't claim certain events took place when they did not, such as my refund being processed. Although it improved and the issue was resolved it took me complaining on the BBB website to get noticed. Unless your package gets to you in perfect condition without any return issues, you may want to reconsider. I suspect returning in the UK is much easier than in the U.S. Communication with someone is difficult. It is a bit of a risk shopping with them in my opinion and I won't be doing it again.

            I needed a dress for a very important interview tuesday morning. I placed the order and paid £6 for next day delivery. I placed the order just after the cut off time friday but was happy to pay because I needed the order by Monday evening. I was promised the order to be delivered Monday by 10pm. Sunday evening came and I had not yet received my dispatch email so I was starting to worry. I messaged them on messenger and they assured my my order would be delivered by Monday. It was now 4.30pm Monday evening and I messaged them again giving them enough time to contact their courier and help me. They said there was nothing they could do and I had to wait until 10pm that night so I waited and nothing. I messaged them to say how upset I was and can they at least try and get another order out to me by 9am the next morning special delivery. I got a reply to say they cannot help and I have to wait 3 days for someone else to contact me. I have been left so stressed out. I just can't believe the lack of responsibility and lack of care given. Just disgusted to be honest.

            Worst customer service I have ever received. I had purchased from ASOS on a few occasions with no issues whatsoever. Until, I forgot my password. They blocked my account due to too many login attempts (Which is a positive), but here's the kicker. I spoke to them on their chat, asking them to unblock me. They forwarded my query on to the ""Specialist Team"" (why have a customer service team if they have to forward ever query to a special team?). I have had an email from the ""Specialist Team"" asking me to change my password, which I have. I am still blocked, so i emailed them back to mention this. They said they would have my account unblocked within 24 hours. It has been a week, spoke to them again today and they said once again ""we'll forward this query onto the specialist team"". I am a little worried i'm being conned. It's an absolute mick take. I've learned my lesson though, I will never save billing information again.

            Item was missing from my order.Emailed several times without any follow up or reply.It seems they just ignore you.I can understand that they are busy,but a short reply to inform status of that missing item would be sufficient.Applied for a refund without any follow up either.Never ordering again and also will tell my friend not to.

            Gradually going down the drain. I have spent a lot of money over many years on ASOS yet this past year I have received terrible declining service. From receiving faulty goods to completely wrong products to being lied to about failed delivery attempts (and most recently being told at 3pm on the delivery day that actually they weren't going to bother delivering) and evasiveness when questioned about reasons for no delivery and lack of communication - I do not trust this site at all anymore!!

            I've used Asos for years and obviously spent a fair bit, but now I'm seriously considering not using them as I recently placed an order and returned one of the items.... Waited and waited for the refund but never received (only received confirmation that they received the item) then got stuck back and forth with customer service who want me to send them copies of my personal bank statement and refusing to provide me with a reference for the refunded payment. Not acceptable and not comfortable sending them person bank statements. Very disappointed.

            I returned 3 items 3 weeks ago but was only refunded for 1. I've chased via email repeatedly and am told it will be investigated but that SLA has long passed. The service via web chat was comical- the guy was clueless and I got 4 completely different answers as to the resolution depending in the question. He had no idea about chargebacks, escalation or a formal complaints process. But I'm to bear with them cos they're very busy. Not once was there an apology. I guess they're not in a hurry to resolve as they have the £70 in their account a bit longer. Caveat Emptor

            Although I love the items on the site, their customer service is absolutely terrible. I have received SEVERAL wrong orders from them and they do nearly nothing to fix the issue. Processing a refund from them could take 20 days or more as they will not refund you (even if they've sent you the wrong item and it was no fault of your own) until they have received the item back that they wrongly sent to you. Once I ordered a dress and they sent me a pair of sandals...how do you screw that up!? I will be wary of ordering from them in the future as they do nothing to remedy the issue, most sites will offer you a discount or promo code to use in the future to keep you in good graces with the company but this company will not. It's a shame I will not be ordering from them again, great items, terrible service.

I contact customer service and they’ve said they’ll contact me within the next NINETEEN days. I needed these items for a vacation I am taking in TWO days. Absolutely ridiculous.

            AVOID - Appalling customer serviceI wish I had read reviews before contacting their customer service, as it could have saved me wasting time trying to get them to sort an issue. Basically, they are not willing to give any customer service. All they needed to do is send the item out again so it would arrive to me in time (instead they say I have to wait for another THREE days to see if the item turns up - even though I paid for NEXT DAY delivery as I need the item in TWO days. So, they had the option to still get it to me in time (as it was ordered for a special celebration) BUT no, they choose to say that there is nothing they can do! I would be embarrassed to give such poor service. Pre-scripted uncaring response.

Made an account, filled out their ""student information"" and I was supposed to get a code. Never received a code so I got on a chat with them to see what was wrong. I sent them my schedule that showed I was enrolled for Fall 2018 semester, my student ID, my student email, and my enrollment letter. They asked for a document with expected graduation date, I didn't have a document like this--- this may be a USA thing where we don't have an exact date unless we apply for graduation.Derby was the person I spoke to. She was rude, unhelpful and rigid. It was just a 10% code I was asking for, the above documents should have sufficed. I'll buy my bridesmaid dress somewhere else.

            I have been shopping with ASOS for over 10 years, rarely do I have anything to complain about. The odd delivery may be delayed or occasionally I've received the wrong item but it's always been fixed within a day. If you do however need to contact customer services for anything I apologise, I have done in the past and they've been rude and incompetent. However again rarely have I complained I work within a customer service centre for an online retailer so I have sympathy for the people who work there and try not to complain unless absolutely necessary. Now it's necessary!On 3rd July I sent 3 items (3 separate orders) back in one returns bag, all listed on the same returns form. On Friday 6th July I received email confirmation advising of the completed refund for one of the items Immediately I chased this up with them via email and they advised me to wait 24hrs and get back in touch, 24hrs passed and still nothing so I emailed. The girls via email were very friendly and assisted where they could but advised that it needed to be passed to a specialist and they'd get back in touch within 14 days. This is an absolute joke, to wait 14 days to be informed what has happened to goods that I sent back in good faith is not acceptable!!I have just had an online chat with an advisor called Ansa and again the level of customer service is disgusting, being a Customer Service Manager for an online retailer myself I know if there is a complaint I should be the one to deal with it. Ansa refused to pass it to someone senior 'as they would only tell me the same' I then asked for contact details for someone at head office. She insulted me further by telling me there was no contact number and giving me the link to the main contact us page that I had just used to speak to her!! Ansa then proceeded to tell me there was nothing more she could do to help so she was ending the chat and that she did.I am appalled at the customer service I've received and the fact that I am being made to wait for a 'specialist' team to look into my query, it's simple someone at the warehouse has lost these goods as they were in the same bag and written on the same piece of paper! I am now being inconvenienced for this. I will be taking this further and I won't be shopping with ASOS again, it's a shame because I think they know they have such a huge customer base there is no need to worry themselves and offer great customer service.

They have no idea what they are doing, where are the packages or why there has been such a long delay in delivery. I ordered several items worth more than $500 on June 25th and have not received anything yet on July 9th. The customer service just exchanges email to tell me to check the porch while the tracking status shows that the package is still in the airport. They ask for address confirmation and finally recommend to wait seven more business days to see what happens. They have no shame. They really don't deserve an eye roll, let alone a star!

Advised that I'd have to wait up to 14 days for someone to deal with my complaint. Advised to buy another jumpsuit and pay delivery and arrange the return of the item.This was an expensive item and in no way was I prepared to buy another one.

            I'm writing in regards to an order I placed on 01/07 and I was advised it would be delivered 5/07, I tracked it Hermes and they said it wont be delivered for a further two working days, so on a Sunday, to my office address where no one will be TWO days late. I screenshot this to ASOS who informed me ""We did state that normal deliveries are taking two days longer than usual"" and I replied ""Oh okay, where does it say this"" and its highlighted under the ""customer care section"", like you look at that when you're placing an order! So I said its obviously going to be late, can you look into this now, ""no sorry, we cant until its passed it official date"" even though I had just explained its confirmed by Hermes its going to late. So I asked for a customer care number to discuss, and was told they don't have one (I know this is a lie because I have spoken to them before), and I said Id rather talk in person, next thing ""here is your customer ref number for this chat, please close the chat when you are ready"".... I hadn't finished! VERY POOR

            I can not believe I’m saying this but as a first time purchase, shopping from ASOS is a disaster and the worst delivery and customer service from them has made me exhausted yet with no package right now while I’m writing this review. They have no problem solving skills as every time they get contacted, they come up with a later date for you to wait for an answer. Now they have delayed the date of giving me an update for the third time, whilst I have found out my package is only some miles away from me at a logistic terminal, it really makes me mad. Instead of writing me to wait 11 or 12 more days, they could have called the terminal as I asked them to.... I have given up on shopping from ASOS.

            I made an order with Asos for about £300 with a Next Day Delivery which I also paid extra for and it didn’t come.I contacted customer service about my order and they said my parcel has been lost and at this point are refusing to give me a full refund. I’ve been told to wait minimum of 12 days until they investigate what happened.My question is why ASOS is not meeting my request as a customer to give me a refund since it’s their fault that my parcel is lost  and also they failed to comply with the purchased Next Day Delivery service.  It is simple, if you don’t deliver as promised, customers ask for refund.Also the customer service of ASOS has been extremely rude and useless, I am not even sure if I would get my refund at all. Not only that but I wasn’t even offered any voucher or discount for the company’s incompetence. My case was seen by the customer support representative as simply an “inconvenience” that my order is gone. Very disappointed by the whole customer experience. i wouldn’t use them EVER again!

            Up to now been a good Company. Sent me a 20% birthday voucher with an expiry date. I used it to buy something using the voucher, about two hours later I found I wanted to order something extra, so I cancelled the original order so that I could order the two items together and get my 20% off. Their system let me cancel the original order, but when I reordered the system said the voucher had already been used. OK, I can sort of see their logic, but in effect I have now not used the voucher. I contacted their Customer Support, and basically got told ""tough"". The revised order was for over £120 after the discount, and I used to buy a lot off ASOS. Not anymore.

            To be honest I don't understand bad reviews.I have only had positive experience with ASOS. I've been ASOS customer for more than 7 years now. I love the choice. I love the free delivery. I love their points system. I always come back to ASOS after trying other online retailers!!! I had a couple of issues with orders and my queries were always sorted quickly. You need to contact Customer services in case of the problem and Customer Service does exist!!! And their customer service is very efficient unlike some other companies. From my experience it takes little time to solve the issues. I also like their own brand and quality.No hassle free returns, quick refunds. Easy!!!I would recommend ASOS to everyone and I do!

            Quality of clothes have deteriorated and the prices increased. Absolute rip off. Makes you wonder who shops with asos when you can visit outlet stores for much cheaper deals. Sometimes cheaper to buy directly from brands own website. Models are not attractive especially for mens clothes. Surely one would realise that the customers are more likely to buy clothes if they look like the models (I don't have tattoos on my face). Stopped using asos a year ago and won't be coming back again until the two issues mentioned have been resolved.

            After having some terrible experiences shopping with other outlets lately and ranting about them on here, it made me realise how efficient ASOS is so wanted to share my opinion. They have become my number one go-to place for all clothes, sportswear, underwear, shoes everything. I've been using them since they launched which was years ago now and the range keeps getting better and better. I always check other outlets when online shopping to look for the best price and ASOS seems to always be competitive and even if they weren't I'd probably shop with them anyway as I trust them and it's always an easy process which is so important when online shopping.They make it so easy to return items and I've never had an issue with being refunded (and quickly). I live rurally and I trust ASOS enough to buy huge orders worth hundreds of pounds in different sizes and styles so I can try everything on at home knowing they'll be no problem returning and getting my money back on any items I don't want to keep. I know this sounds like it should be the basics, but if you read my reviews of House of Fraser or Uniqlo you'll realise some companies make returning things a nightmare - if they even arrive to begin with! Also this brilliant customer service is coupled with a really easy to use website which looks great, really cute write-ups for the items and a massive amount of choice in terms of style, sizes, brands, prices.

            NEVERMORE.I bought a bikini to wear on the beach last weekend. Parcel was meant to be delivered on Friday but DPD is rubbish. They took a picture of the door of the building where it was meant to be delivered and that's it. I arranged collection in one of the really few stores around and the store is inaccessible. I've requested for the parcel to be back and refunded and they told me that it will take 12 working days. Let's see if I can get my money back.This is quite unacceptable, never had this issues with other retailers.

            The chat service is a joke. It appears to be mostly for show because they rarely resolve any of your problems. For the second time running I've had a delivery problem. I had conflicting messages from Hermes - one saying there was an attempted delivery but I wasn't in (I was), and one saying they couldn't deliver because the package was damaged. Used the chat service (where the woman took ten minutes to reply to every question) and asked what was happening. She told me should would inform the relevant department and I should hear back within 7 days. I asked what normally happens in cases like this (would I be sent a replacement item if it was damaged? etc) and all she would say was ""the other department will tell you that."" They take your money, often don't deliver (this isn't the first time this has happened to me), and then won't give you any answers or resolutions on the chat service. Yet they hold your money indefinitely. Have finally learned my lesson and won't be buying from them again.

            I've been buying my trousers for work from ASOS own branded trousers for a long time but it seems that every year/season the quality of the trousers is declining. The fabric is getting thinner and it easily creases as a result, it also does not wash well, the fabric is already pilling and I only had it for three months. I have another ASOS trouser I've bought two years and it still looks good as new. Please make some changes ASOS, I would rather see an increase on price rather than a reduction on quality as at the moment I would no longer consider buying ASOS own brand trousers.

            I have shopped with ASOS for many years and always had a great experience. Recently however, I’ve had problem after problem with my orders - I’ve spent so much time dealing with terrible customer service (they used to be so good), receiving nothing but pat answers - and they just blatantly ignore anything they don’t want to deal with. I really don’t understand how a company can go from being so good to so bad in what appears to be such a short amount of time. I would say without exaggeration that I have a problem with every other order I make (mostly things missing); in fact, I ended up here because I was beginning to get paranoid it was only happening to me and I wanted to see what the general experience is like...must admit I’m glad it’s not just me!I’m currently going through a situation in which  two items are missing from an order I made and received over a week ago. They’ve still taken my money for all the items and after a very unsatisfactory conversation (manners not present) on live chat, I was informed it was going to take the “specialist team” six days to work out why I have two items missing. SIX DAYS! I can tell you why right now ASOS - it’s because you are suddenly completely incompetent.

            I am really surprised with all those negative reviews about asos. I am assuming I have been extremely lucky for last 3 years. Half of my wardrobe is from asos, I have returned milions of clothes and I have never had an issue getting refund or any issues with delivery. Maybe the London Asos warehouse is really good, dont know about other ones. If you live in london I can definitely reccomand it. You will receive your order with no issue and get refund quickly if needed. Keep the good job!

            Can’t believe I’m writing this - asos have always been spot on with customer service, I literally don’t know what’s happened lately!?! Haven’t placed an order for a few months but been a premier customer the last 3 years. I recently was away and I couldn’t access my birthday money off code, they said they would pass it on to a “specialist” team - 2 weeks down the line - nothing.I then ordered a water bottle which was faulty - contacted them about it but again passed to the “relevant”people. Heard nothing since - in the past they would have sent a replacement without even questioning you about it or wanting you to send it back. To make matters worse ive tweeted 5/6 times and not getting any replies, even dm them directly - nothing. Wrote another tweet to them and got my girlfriend to do the same, they replied her and not me, soon as she replied sayin to reply to my tweets they never responded. Asos is the only place I shop for clothes - but as soon as my membership is up I won’t be buying from them again 👎🏼 Avoid

            I ordered on 26 June at 11.26pm using next day delivery. The order was despatched on 27 June at 06.22am. Soon after I recieved 2 emails from both DPD saying my item would be delivered and from UK MAIL saying my item would be delivered in the evening. I was confused that I recieved 2 emails.My next day order never arrive. I called UK mail and they said it would be delivered on the 28 June istead as they hadn't received it yet. It didn't arrive on this day either. I contacted ASOS  (28th June) to ask about my order and the agent was rude and cut me off when I asked for compensation and didn't sort my order out. I contacted ASOS once again at roughly 9pm and was told that my order would be delivered by 10pm or by the next day.I keep checking the tracking on both DPD and UK mail and neither say they have received the package or have any tracking after the line that says your parcel will be with us soon etc.Next day delivery has so far taken 3 days. I have been told it was delivered and signed by me at 6.30pm when I was in my room and window is next to the front door. So know one knocked at all.

Package said delivered but was not there. Spoke with a chat agent and said the investigations team will follow up within 48 hours. How long does it take to actually look into it. I have not gotten a response yet and followed up again. It has been 3 days. They will just give you lies and push the timeline to 6 DAYS. Will just give stupid excuses. Will not issue you a refund nor answer your questions. And yes, they will close the chat on you and when you return for another agent, they will transfer you to Sarah who never responds.

Why would I waste time looking at their stuff and placing an order if they can't even ensure it is delivered.

            Terrible, Horrible worst internet shopping ever!  They said the delivery fee is free but it costs 22CAD for receiving.I mentioned about it to them and they replied me below. ""Customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country. These charges must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. We have no control over these charges, and can't tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. It's a good idea to contact your local customs office for current charges before you order in the future, so you're not surprised by charges you weren't expecting."" Who can expect about the import duties without note!They must have so many inquiry from people who has same trouble before but they don't mention on their website.

            Initially I really liked this company. They had nice quality clothing and actually fit my tall husband.  However I’ve had a lot of problems with them lately. They send me someone else’s packages twice. I could have kept the items but I took the time and trouble to return them to the company. They did nothing to thank me. Which I let go of initially. However, I placed an order for 2 day shipping, which I know 100% I selected. My husband saw me do it. I needed the dress for a wedding before I left on a trip. They then changed the shipping to 4 days but not only will it not arrive in 4 days it will arrive 10 days from now. I contact them to ask them to make the adjustment. They refuse to help me. I just spent $160 at their company and paid for shipping and they wouldn’t fix their mistake. What an incompetent joke of a company. I will never shop there again. They really should have given me a coupon for helping them out twice but instead they stole my shipping money and made sure my order wouldn’t arrive in time.

            Spoke to a lady called Lateefah on live chat regarding DPD turning up and not bothering to deliver my order (he parked directly outside, took a picture of the buildings opposite, then drove off and notified me that there was nobody in to take my parcel). She ignored my issue, claimed that nothing had gone wrong and implied it was my fault for not answering the door, despite me pointing out that the driver himself had taken a photo of the wrong address. When I asked her if a refund of my the postage costs was possible, she again ignored the issue and like a robot asked me if there was anything else she could help me with. So as I've paid through PayPal, I've raised a claim with them to get my postage back. I didn't pay £6 to watch the delivery man, with my parcel in his van, directly outside my flat, take a picture of a completely different building, and then proceed to drive off without even leaving a calling card. A shame when ASOS gets its right everywhere else (price, quality, ease of ordering)... all let down by a chatbot (might as well have been) and a rubbish courier.

            Alright, so I’ll start by saying that I’ve ordered from ASOS before with no problem. However, this time has been an absolute nightmare and they’ve lost my business forever. I ordered several items on the first of the month and was notified that they would be delivered by the 12th. The tracking showed the package’s arrival at JFK on the 6th- where it stayed for the next 6 days. When I called to inquire about this, I was told there had been a delay and my package would arrive on the 14th. Ok two weeks is past their promised 2-7 day shipping but I understand that international shipping is lengthy. When the customer service representative confirmed my address at the end of the chat, it was my old address in a different state instead of the new address I had entered and saved. Ok, technical difficulties are frustrating but understandable. The customer service rep offered to send a replacement to my correct address with express shipping, which was appreciated. He had me change my address in the system, which gave me an error code several times before allowing me to save it on my mobile device. He confirmed that he could see my correct address in my account TWICE. I received a confirmation email the next day and one of the items I had ordered was now out of stock. Frustrating, but again understandable. But any guesses what the shipping address was when I scrolled through that email? That’s right, they AGAIN shipped it to the wrong address. When I contacted customer service to express my frustration and see what they could do to resolve the issue, they told me that it could not be re-routed on their end and to contact UPS. If I could somehow return the packages delivered to the wrong address in a different state THEN they would refund me. Worst customer care. If you mess up twice and you customer still does not have the package in their possession you should automatically refund the card. So now I’ve had to ask a friend to pick up and ship both packages to me, which was not cheap. And it’s been an absolute nightmare with UPS as anyone who has used them for shipping knows. Still don’t have my package that I ordered a full month ago now. I mean, please don’t shop with ASOS. The nightmarish pergatory you’ll be stuck in is not worth it.

            Rubbish customer service! I have used asos for years and they have generally been good at delivering when they're supposed to. But this last week I have been having to chase them daily to find out where my order is. I placed my order on 14 June with delivery expected on 15 June and it didn't arrive so I chased them on 16 June. When I originally contacted them, they told me I'd have to wait 48 hours for a response and this time period elapsed with no contact from them. I've contacted them daily since and each day they issue a new timeline of 3-5 working days for when I should get a response from them with an update on my order.  And now, each day the 5th working day of their 3-5 working day timeline just keeps moving further and further back!!! I have repeatedly asked them just to cancel my order and refund me, but they refuse, stating this spurious, ever-extending timeline!! The irony is that I recently renewed my Premier delivery subscription to be able to get next day delivery and to add insult to injury, the items that I ordered I've been able to find alternatives elsewhere!! ASOS just give me back my money and let's call it quits!! I'm so over you with this order!!! I want my refund now!!

            I've worked in retail 20+ years, measuring customer for custom fit suits.  I ordered a jumpsuit according to my measurements and ordered the size recommended by the size guide (size 8), which I thought was way too big, but size guide said ""true to size"".  It was way too big!  I did return the jumpsuit and ordered a size 4, which was perfect for me, but not according the the size chart.....  I love the jumpsuit and would like to order again, but exchanges are not allowed, so I had to re-order the right size and wait for a refund for the return.

            Worst online shopping experience I have ever encountered. Ordered an item and they sent me a inferior item which is 1/3 of the price I paid, didn’t even tell me that they sent me a different item. I informed customer service who just said these things can happen. I complained and they just said if you don’t like the item just return it for a refund. I will never shop from ASOS again and if you read the reviews on here and decide to buy from this company then you must be mad. Avoid at all costs is my advice. The behaviour of this company and its customer service is very poor.

            I ordered a jumper for my rehearsal dinner. It didn’t arrived by the delivery date so I checked the tracking and It hadnt been updated. I reached out to ASOS and they quickly replied that it would be here June 15(4 days after the original expected delivery). June 18 I decided to reach back out and ask for an update. They lost my package. I told the really unhelpful gentleman that this was for my rehearsal dinner and now that that has passed I am done dealing with their company and just would like a refund. Well he refused. He said they reported it to their “shipment team” and they’ll be in touch. So I got online to try to call someone to get different help. You can’t. You can only chat with someone who will copy and paste the same response over and over again. I spent $200 on this order and much more before that. I will never purchase from ASOS again.

            ASOS has wonderful customer service, and I love their large selection and options for tall and/or petite women. I order from them all of the time.I had an issue with an order recently. I ordered a pair of boots that gave me wounds. After bringing it up to ASOS, they offered a compete refund without the need to return the shoes, and were very helpful and attentive to the situation. They were genuinely concerned about the damage that was caused from their product and were taking action to make sure the issue was looked into from a manufacturing standpoint.Thank you ASOS!

            I have an event in another country, and wanted to have the dresses within 2 days, I only ordered because I read that they can deliver in 2-3 days. and thats why I paid an extra 10 euros. unfortunately the dresses got delayed and they told me I will not receive it until in a week. So now the dresses are useless actually and the money I paid went down the drain. I can't cancel now I have to wait until they bring it and send it back THEN I get my money in 5-10 days. So ya.

            Poor non existent customer service. Generic robotic answers, I contacted them on Facebook, chat and email and I received the SAME answer, word for word, they won't admit that they have made a mistake.  The last person I spoke to on the chat, a Charlotte was so rude and couldn't understand my issue, asking me to place a new order, THE DRESS is sold out!!  I made a order on the 12 of June. It was sent quite quickly and was out for delivery on the 14th, cool I thought, my local Hermes will just deliver it through the letterbox and this will be the end of this story. But no.. Hermes couldn't deliver my parcel and I look on the tracking number, where it says they will try again in 24 hours, great I thought, I will be home then. Bear in mind that I haven't received any emails at all from Hermes.. so come Friday or Saturday,  I check my tracking number and it now says 'return to sender' I am like what the heck, this never had happened, I have over 20 orders ALL MADE TO THAT ADDRESS!!! I contact asos, and this is where I am met by a wall of rudeness, they said that it's Hermes fault and that I should contact them, then I did that, and Hermes says it's asos as a retailer that should contact them to stop the return?.... Rude employees at asos tells me to just make a reorder, thanks alot - But the item is sold out, which means that they didn't even bother to look at that (they tell me they don't know when it will be in stock... I didn't ask for that!!)? I worked in customer service for a big online company, I know what good customer service is, I definitely didn't receive that here... They won't even give me a compensation for my time and inconvenience. All I wanted is a we are sorry for this, I can definitely see that there has been a mistake here...

            Overall a good option for online fashion.I think people are being harsh giving it 1 or 2 stars. Their customer service can be quite long, in the sense of when you have a problem with your order it takes a lot of back and forth in order to resolve it.Other than that, it is a highly convenient website with great selection. For the prices they sell, we can't expect a 5 star customer service but they come close enough from it.I would recommend.

I was very stressed, and told them I do not like owing money when I don’t and wanted some sort of confirmation.I ended up making a complaint, I spoke with Dominic over Webchat. He told me he had resolved my issue by telling me to go to Klarna and tell them myself, of which I told him surely they could not take me just on my word and he provided an answer of maybe.I actually had to ask for an apology for their admin error, as prior to that all he had said was ‘sorry for your inconvenience’.When I asked who he was governed by he would not answer, saying he was able to resolve the issue. He did not resolve the issue and he then ended the chat, without further explanation.Shoddy practise, no appreciation for loyal customers.

            They have great prices and free postage. Free returns. They have no issues accepting late returns (unlike Zalando).  Offer immediate replacements for damaged items.Only complain is that customer service is really unconventional that they often just close the chat. I think the customer should not close by itself. But they are really attentive, sympathetic and knowledgable.I definitely recommended it to all my friends. And I have ordered around 50 orders yet.

Needed to visit my doctor for anti inflammatory medication as the shoe completely snapped and I was as left injured in town centre and embarrassed - seeking legal advice - Don’t seem to care about stress or inconvenience.

            Order was returned and confirmed via Collect Plus tracking that it was received by ASOS 2 days ago. When I contact customer service to see when my refund would be processed, I was told they haven't received it and wait another 11 days, even though I confirmed it shows the journey online and that it was received. Was also told I cannot make a complaint as customer services deal with everything. Quick enough to take your money but wont return. Appalling.

            I have to leave a one star purely due to the terrible postage times and lack of customer service regarding the postage. I live in Australia and years ago Asos used to have super fast shipping over here. I would receive my package within days. They have now been using TERRIBLE courier services in Australia to deliver their products. I have contacted the Asos customer service multiple times to tell them how bad their partner courier companies here are and they did not care one bit. It wasnt even a 'oh we will take that into consideration'. It was just a 'too bad deal with it'. I even stopped using Asos due to this fact about a year ago, but about 2 weeks ago I decided I would give them another go to see if hopefully they had chosen a better courier partner, however nothing has changed. I've been waiting 2 weeks for my package,  the Australian Courier company (Couriers Please) have had my package for 7 days and they have not once attempted to deliver. I am awaiting a response from their customer service... Its also the fact that Asos try to tell you that you will have your item in a few days.. its been 2 weeks. Its false advertising.

            I got these partyline wide fit platform heels in a size 2 and I was so ecstatic because no shop ever sells size 2 heels for women. The delivery was fine and the quality is good however, they are not a size 2 but more like a 3! There is so much gap in the heel that I can’t get away with putting anything there to close the gap. The same thing had happened with a pair of sandals however I can get away with them as they aren’t heeled. I don’t know whether ASOS don’t know their sizing or whether they just put size 2 but actually make sizes 3 but they are definitely not size 2. If you have small feet under size 3 don’t get shoes from here!!!!

            Worst customer service ever! I ordered of their site in the beginning of May. They said I would receive at the latest the 15 May. When I haven't received it yet on the 20 May I wrote to them, and they promised to look in to it.I have since written to them like a dozen times, because they never went back to me.. They always make the same excuses, that they are looking in to it and I will have to wait 48h until they will have an answer. That is now a month a go they started to promise me this.. And i still haven't received neither my order or my money back.. They doesn't want to help me. And closed my online chat while I was chatting with them, just because they didn't know what to answer me.. I will never shop on this site again..

            I cannot even begin to explain the disgusting level of ""Customer Service"". Repeated robotic emails with no sincere apologies or assistance! I received my parcel on the 31st May, returned back on the 1st June. The 4th June it was delivered back to them. On the 11th June, I contacted them for an update on my refund... as I know it can take up to 7 working days to process this. I received an email ""apologising"" for the delay, stating that the parcel had been received and I should have a refund actioned by the 12th (today). Then, I get another email saying they haven't got my parcel 🤔 and to contact them today if I'd not heard anything. Still not heard anything, contacted them to then be informed that I have to wait until the 19th?! How is it acceptable to allow a customer to wait 18 days after a parcel was sent and 15 days for a refund to be processed after it has been received? Then to add to the insult that 3-5 working days for the funds to show as available!! I know they will not be bothered by this review, as you can tell by all the others. They should respect their customers and help them! That's all we ask

            Ordered some dresses 9th April 2018, parcel turns up damaged (with DPD tape all over it) and 2 items missing.  Tell ASOS and it’s now 12th June and still no refund for the missing items.  I’ve e:mails lots, used live chat, messenger etc.. and all I get is “let me apologise for the delay in resolving your query”.  I lodged 2 separate complaints without getting any formal acknowledge or progress update except them saying “we are looking into this”.  It’s quite honestly the worse and the slowest customer service I’ve ever received.  Appreciate they have processes to follow for missing items but to take over 2 months to sort something so basic is atrocious.

            I have ordered dresses on Sunday. As this is quite urgent, I requested a next day delivery. They did delivered the next day, but as I am working, I wasn't there, and as this is delivered with DPD, I couldn't pick the parcel up at the post office. So I organised to have a delivery to a local shop today. Then, I received a SMS saying that ""as requested"", the delivery will be on the 13th, which is tomorrow, when I never requested this. So I have paid for a next day delivery, but will receive it (maybe) tomorrow, so 3 days after. I have contacted the customer service which couldn't help me because I have ordered through my boyfriend's email address. Really unhappy, should have checked Trustpilot before ordering anything. Won't do it again.

            Do not shop at ASOS. The company is not U.S. based and they do not offer immediate customer service. I placed an order online May 31 and my delivery was scheduled for June 8th. Upon getting my package every item I ordered was incorrect. I searched the website hoping to find a customer service number but they did not have one only could be contacted via email. After several hours and days of delay communicating via email they informed me that all the items that I had ordered were no longer in stock and they could not fulfill my order. Highly upset because at the time the items were there and had my order been fulfilled correctly I would have received my items. I am an avid online shopper and have never experienced such unprofessionalism. So long story short DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS.

            I ordered these shoes from ASOS: RAID Helena Grey Multi Buckle Grunge Flat Ankle Boots - Grey / UK 6 and within 4 months they had split nearly all the way accross the sole on the left shoe and starting to show the same damage on the right. Holes have appeared at the seams and where the fabric joins the sole - for the amount of money I paid for them this is unacceptable. This wouldnt have been so bad as it is reasonable to expect that this will happen from time to time but coupled with a customer service who responded to my varied and detailed questions with 'i do not have this information at hand' or 'this is decided else where' and repeats there of really gave a real sense of a distinct lack of caring ASOS has for their customers. Big slow clap for ASOS!! If customer reviews were allowed on their website I would post a lot of images of shocking quality shoes falling apart after only around 12 weeks of wear so I can see why they don't have that facility!! Very poor quality items and astoundingly dissapointing customer care!

            I am a petite girl and was thrilled to find a Petite section on Asos' website. Using the measurements of each item on the site, I put in an order I was very excited about, because by the measurements the clothing would fit perfectly! Needless to say, every single article of clothing was a completely different size than what was advertised on the site.I had to pay all of the shipping costs to return the items to them, and still 3 months later, I hadn't heard anything from the company. I tried to contact them to see about my return and refund, and they said they couldn't do anything about it and their customer service was very bland, unhelpful, and it seemed like the agent was basically copying and pasting paragraphs from a manual.Looking back, I definitely wish I didn't order with them, because a huge warning sign was that they don't allow customer reviews on their website. If they did allow reviews, I would have seen all of the awful things people are saying here, and steered clear of this terrible company. NEVER AGAIN, AVOID AT ALL COST!

            Ordered a designer item on sale 9 days ago and it has still not arrived. Been emailing them, asking them where my goods have gone as monies have left my account. In the meantime, the item has now gone back up in price and seems they don't want to honour the transaction. They claim my order 'just hasn't been sent' and they do not know why but we will order a replacement -Subject to availability, which no one has come back to me on....The item is now 'Out of stock' as its been so long.All in all, after my many emails and telephone calls to chase this missing order, it was a complete waste of time! A big failure of ASOS' part.I shop online all the time and have never experience such stressful and disappointingly bad shopping experience. Certainly won't be shopping with them again or believe any of their sale prices the next time it pop up on my online ads.

Instead of getting bikini bottom and a top I got two bottoms. I immediately contacted them through this chat and she told me they would try to find a new one the next 24hrs. On Thursday I got an email saying they didn’t have it and refunded me. Next day (on friday) I got an email saying the bikini top was on its way! Great costumer service.

They should have prorated the promo code discount to all my items but instead they reduced my returns by the ENTIRE promo code. SCAM!!!! And I kept more than half of my order. I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SITE AGAIN. Can't talk to anyone either, only chat. They won't let you chat with a supervisor either. they have well-trained staff to give you NO Customer Service!

            Shocking service. Still trying to squeeze a replacement out of them 2 weeks after a DPD driver was witnessed returning to his van with my parcel and driving off, leaving me with a missing delivery. Because he claims to have left it in the garden they have dragged it out for as long as possible 'chasing with DPD' (the amount of times I've been told to wait another 3-5 days is laughable). They're only interested in getting their claim from DPD and don't care that I have paid money and have nothing to show for it. They copy and paste answers too which is the most patronising way to be treated as a customer. I was a loyal customer ordering  regularly but will be cancelling my premier account ASAP and going elsewhere. I work in customer service myself and can safely say if I provided this poor level of service to one of my customers, I would be disciplined by my manager! Stay away!

            I have bought a dress via asos on Saturday. Immediately after purchase I've received an error on your site. So the money was paid via Paypal , but there is no order on the site. I've contacted seller, but he told me to contact asos. I've contacted seller again via Paypal, but no answer. Then I've contacted asos by their contact email, but no answer! I'm very very unhappy about that. On asos site I even can't find messages sent to the seller! I don't trust asos anymore. It is too much problems with the purchase via this site. Not going to use asos ever in my life again.

            Absolutely awful customer service. Ordered a dress and needed to exchange for a smaller size. They said absolutely fine for a free exchange. Then they refunded the money. I could not repurchase the dress as it had gone up in price. I was on chat for and hour and 15 minutes and they would not let me exchange/re order the dress for the same price. What a waste of my time. Tried to offer me discount codes that did not even match the original price I paid, then suggested I re purchase full price and then contact for a refund, I don't trust them now so wouldn't do this. Online chat is the only help available and they don't care. They hope if they waste your time for long enough you will go away which is what I had to do in the end.

            Nobody’s perfect but what I appreciate from ASOS is even if they have made a mistake they would admit it and apologize. I have been buying off ASOS for years and I have been always in constant contact with their customer service. Some days they take forever to respond while others in an instant. But you should know that that no matter what they will always respond to your mail. I have complete trust in their products and service. They literally make my life easier and that’s why ASOS is my go-to!

            Guys do not buy from ASOS. Purchased a watch and it had a defect which prevented it from clicking and it always fell. took it to a horologist and he told me it was a defective product. The price to repair the watch would be greater than the cost of the watch itself.I also bought sunglasses but it was not UV resistant as it mentioned. While driving the sunlight hit through the sunglasses and made it extremely difficult to focus on the road. At one point I could not see my speedometer due to the knockoff product they sold. They falsely advertise and do not give crucial information about products. First and last time I purchased there.

            Long story..I spent about £120 in the sale, just to update the basics in my wardrobe and add a little colour ready for the summer.I asked for the delivery address to be the same as the billing address. But when I got a notification that it was delivered, I hadn't heard a knock on the door or had a delivery slip come through so I was really confused.I went on the website and ended up talking to a customer service representative through their instant chat. She informed me that it had been sent to a different city, to an address I didn't recognise, because that's my default delivery address.. I found it very strange, she offered to send me a replacement order. She made sure I had deleted the unknown address from my address book before she sent the replacement.Shortly after that conversation, I realised I had a friend in the city it was sent to, and reached out to see if she knew the address. It really is a small world, because she did, and she was willing to contact the guy she knew to get my parcel back. I didn't want to be committing fraud by reporting a parcel as undelivered, getting a replacement and getting the original. So I got in touch again using instant chat. I explained to the new customer advisor that I had spoken to one of his colleagues and I just needed him to cancel the replacement order as I could get it back myself. He thanked me, and did as I asked.Once I got the order, I noticed there were items missing. 6 in total, which amounted to around £40. I didn't have a delivery note so I felt like there was nothing I could do. To be sure, once again I used the chat feature to talk to customer services. They apologised and asked for a list of the missing items. They offered me replacements where possible and a refund for those out of stock.Where do we think this replacement order was sent?! Yup, the same place as the first one!I got in touch again, making sure they knew this was ridiculous. I spoke with Daniel who took AGES to respond to me. He made very little apology, considering this is their mistake. He suggested that I make arrangements to get it myself. I don't really know how he expected me to do that since my friend was on holiday, but he didn't have any other suggestions. 11 minutes to have a conversation that should have taken 3 at most. Brilliant..I made it very clear that I would never shop with them again. How can you send my parcel to an address not in my address book, and then expect me to clean up the mess..?!

            I place orders with ASOS frequently and have done so from many different countries (UK, Sweden & Canada) and has never had a problem. UK offers next day delivery which is great but even abroad the delivery time is good. Never have an issue with returns or exchanges and refunds are processed quickly. They now offer KLARNA which I love because if you are ordering multiple sizes or not sure about an item you don't have to wait for a refund, just simply pay the bill when you know what you're keeping and what is going back.

I just had a chat with them, and because THEY send an wrong item, that I did NOT order, they want me to send it back, so they can send me the right item.. but the problem is I actually like the wrong item, and I wanna keep it, but they want me to send it back anyways. Like why?? I wanna keep it. Why make it such a big deal. All I wanted was for them to reconize that they made a mistake and maybe give a discount because of THEIR mistake, so I can get the one I actually ordered. Like.

            I recently ordered $50 worth of swimwear from asos. Unfortunately, neither the top nor bottom fit well so I ended up returning both of them. The quality was the same as you'd get from Target or any other cheaper-priced swimwear store. I received the items within 3 days of ordering, even though I only did standard shipping. I was pretty nervous to return the items because of previous bad reviews, so I ended up taking screenshots of all of my order and delivery information and kept a close eye on the tracking. However, I didn't need to do any of that (but I'm still glad I did just incase) because the return was completely smooth. They had a free return slip through USPS, tracking is free, they contacted me the day the tracking said they got it and confirmed that they did, and I received my full refund within a few days. Perhaps I got lucky, or they changed up how they do the returns since the other bad reviews, but I had a great experience with them even though the clothes didn't work out.

            Great selection of almost everything, love the option of buy now pay later with Klarna which means you can order things, try them on and only pay for what you keep. The only slight downside is that while it says “with you on or before xxx” it usually comes later than advertised. But as I’m not one to buy things in a rush it’s ok but it might bother there who need a last minute outfit so be aware it might not arrive on the day they say. But overall I will happily order again

No one at DPD or ASOS seems inclined to assist and I just have to wait, while being reminded how happy ASOS is of their own.A final point, stock seems to be an issue. So many items out of stock.

            Not worth it, if you are shipping internationally don't waste your time with ASOS. Shop at mango or something. They have free shipping and returns and amazing customer service. Every time I shop at Asos I regret it. My total came to $380 and I paid $140 for duty only and $15 for Express delivery. I paid extra for delivery and it still takes longer than when I place orders with Mango, which ships it right away. I literally get my order in 3-5 days with Mango. But with Asos I haven't even seen the clothes yet, and I just hope they look and fit well because I can't even return them since it won't be worth it.

            No joke, 3 of my last 4 orders have been incorrect. One was the wrong jeans completely, the second was a jacket in the wrong colour. However, today was a new low, not only were the jeans completely wrong, but they have a huge tear in the crotch and clearly look like someone has worn them a few times and returned them. 9 hours later, I am yet to hear back from ASOS apart from the auto generated nonsense. Will never ever use again

            This time around I have had a VERY BAD experience with Asos. I returned some items and they have confirmed that they have received these but haven't refunded me my £96! It has been nearly 3 weeks! I've contacted them via telephone and email (each time having to repeat the same details). They asked for a statement and I sent them a csv file from my online account (I can only download in csv from their website). I explained this to Asos and to show authenticity, I also sent screenshots but to my dismay, they have said that this is unacceptable. Furthermore, they were unable to open the csv file but had the audacity to patronise me and say that if I don't have the capability to send a pdf then I should ask a friend or family for help. I'm a computer scientist! They want me to print off the statement and send in photographs of this print out instead! Doesn't make any sense to me why they can't accept the screen shot! I've been quite stressed because we're not just talking about a couple of pounds and I have bills to pay! It has definitely made me think twice about shopping with Asos ever again!

That’s all fine these things happen but it’s the lack of contact I find so unacceptable, I have now sent so many emails, they have no phone line and nothing.  Never again. Do not shop there!

            Among a huge number of online stores with non-refundable items poorly made and shipped from China, Asos is NOT one of them. I have been buying from them for several years now, and yes, not all sizes fit me, but it had never been a problem, because the refunds are super fast, the fabric is exactly as described, and to this day I get compliments on several Asos dresses. They are unique and have tons of options.

I was looking for a refund with a proof of returning - almost 2 months, nothing here. Still chasing.

            Never ordering from them again. I returned one pair of jeans and they refunded me for the wrong pair and because of that, the refund was much less than they owe me. They claimed to have updated the refund and it should show up in my bank statement in X business days. After 3 weeks, I still didn't see this refund.I contacted ASOS and told them and they asked me to wait another week, totaling a whole month. Again, nothing. I contacted ASOS once more and they asked for a credit card statement PDF because a screenshot isn't enough. Okay, that's weird but fine. I send them a single page PDF with a duration of 2 weeks where the refund never came. ""No, it has to be a full statement"". I sent them a full statement with my personal info and non-related transactions crossed out. ""No, you can't block out content from the statement"". Sure, let me give all this personal information to a bunch of strangers in a foreign country because that's what most people would do right? Wrong. After going back and forth for *3 MONTHS* over this stupid non-sense, I told them I'm filing a chargeback on my credit card and that  was EXACTLY what I did. Got my money back. My biggest mistake was not filling for the chargeback earlier. Also, every time I sent the an email, a different rep would respond and the rep would have no freaking idea what my issue is or what they're talking about.

The quality is great.  Shipping and returns are free, which is awesome.  They processed all my orders fast and got them in a reasonable time, along with my returns!  They do not do exchanges, so as I was reading some reviews, if you want to exchange, just return the item and re order it, because shipping and returns are free you might at well!  All three orders I have had a great easy time.

            The clothes I orderd are mostly ok. The wedding dress is nice except it is more yellowish than it should be. The same dress is more white on the video, of course. The other items were completely fine.I ordered two wedding dresses and returned the size that didn't fit. The price was 200 GBP. I followed the instructions for the return, and after 40 days it seems that my dress didn't arrive in their warehouse. Why? Somebody stole it because it was untracked item. This issue is common but they don't want to inform you about it because people don't want to pay for returns, and it's complicated, and they wouldn't buy many items. It's of psychological nature. So, I lost 200 GPB because I didn't know that I should've payed for sending it back to them. It would cost me 10-20 GBP, but I wouldn't lose 200. If I were smarter, I would do it, but I trusted the system. Foolish.

            This company is getting worse. I recently purchased some shoes in the sale only to receive an email from ASOS saying they had sold out! When I purchased them they were not low in stock..... I have been shopping with them for over 10 years  and the service being received is disgusting. For a company as big as they are they should make sure they have enough stock. They are also very under handed when it comes to sales, they will reduce items at knock down prices eg original price, then a sale price then a further reduction then if they have 20% off they will put the price back up to the original reduction price. The service being received by this company is terrible.....AVOID. What I would really like to know is WHY if ASOS do not test on animals do they sell products that are. I am against animal cruelty and I find this hypocritical of them. Juicy Couture use real fur in their clothing products.....SHAME ON YOU ASOS.

I even actually went NEGATIVE sending back clothes because i needed to buy a box to do so. This doesn't add up, because the promotion had different levels of qualification. I still qualified for the promotion, but simply not the original monetary amount. I returned $105 of clothes, lost my $100 of promotion (which means $5 refunded for $105 worth of clothes,)  and am left with a live-chat response of somebody who has no clue of my situation.

            I returned two orders about two weeks ago, requesting a refund. ASOS supposedly provides no-hassle free shipping AND returns. You’d think this is a great perk for the customer, however, their return procedures are flawed. Customers should beware. I waited the 10 days before reaching out about my return as ASOS says returns take up to 10 business days. When I received my packages they included return labels and instructions for making the return. Their marketing on their website and return instructions within the shipments tote a hassle free process. You’re simply supposed to remove the original shipment label on the package, replace it with the prepaid return label (paid and provided by ASOS) and then either leave it for your mail carrier or drop it in your local neighborhood mailbox bin for USPS to pick up. I did exactly as the instructions said. When I contacted ASOS regarding my return orders they asked for “proof of postage” and said it was the responsibility of the customer to 1. add tracking to the return package and 2. also “insure the items” that are being returned. These steps are NOT included in their return instructions. When asked what is “proof of postage”, I didn’t receive a concrete answer. After telling them that the return instructions DO NOT mention these additional steps, they resent me an email with the same script, repeating that I need to provide proof of postage and until I do that there is nothing they can do. I then asked them why they wouldn’t know the tracking information for the return label that THEY provided. They then sent me an email saying they looked up the tracking for they return labels they provided and said it came back as “invalid”. SO THE TRACKING NUMBER FOR THE RETURN POSTAGE ASOS PROVIDED IS INVALID?? AND SOMEHOW THAT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND FAULT?? They also looked this up for only one of the package orders I returned. So in a subsequent email I asked them to track the other second package. The “tracking number” that was assigned turned out to be the SAME as the other package they “supposedly” looked up: 1001000000000000000**SSN**1. ASOS are frauds. To end, the last email I received from them condescendingly advised the following “I can suggest contacting the carrier you returned your items with and asking for proof of postage or a tracking number”. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THIS? GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR PROOF OF POSTAGE FOR PACKAGES THAT ARE NO LONGER IN MY POSESSION AND HAVE BEEN MAILED 2 WEEKS AGO?? ASOS is a joke, and they do not care about their customers. I have scrolled through several customer review sites including this one, and this issue with refunds and returns goes back for YEARS. Why haven’t they updated their return instructions on the slip included in packages stating that customers should add tracking AND insure their items? Its because if they did, the return wouldn’t be considered free. Instead they place blame on the customer on the backend and refuse to honor returns. Save yourself the stress and money. Do not purchase goods through ASOS. I'll be submitting this review on others sites. Hopefully it helps others who review businesses before giving them their money. I will from now on.

            Sent me the wrong item and when I contacted them they said they'd send a replacement because I already returned it 10 working days ago. ASOS are claiming they don't even have my returned INCORRECT item that they sent by mistake in the first place! To add insult to injury they tell me my item I originally ordered and paid for is now out of stock. Unbelievably so, they also told me I still needed to send them the item for me to receive the refund (Which I didn't want.. only wanted the item I actually ordered) So now they're withholding a refund I'm 100% entitled too because they won't acknowledge I sent the wrong item back - which I even proved with a dated postage receipt!! I used to love ASOS but I don't think I'll ever shop with them again, they've totally lost my respect.

            Be careful if you have to return an item and used a promo code when you made a purchase.  I returned $161 of merchandise but only received $61 back because they took off the full promo I received when I made the purchase.  If I had returned $100 of merchandise I would have received a refund of $100 because the promo would still apply.  Makes no sense.  Most companies prorate the promo for the items you kept.  I would have received a larger refund if I had returned fewer items.  You could actually end up owning them money for returning items with the way their return policy works.  Avoid at all costs.  Spoke with a customer service rep and they just didn't care; it's the way it works.

            I was very doubtful to buy in this website because of all the reviews I saw. However, I was looking for this dress I saw on The Voice and ASOS was the only store that had it, so I decided to give it a try. The dress arrive on time and it was the same size I asked for. The only detail is that it was missing a the belt that comes with the dress, but I asked them and they sent me whole new dress the next day (this time with the belt included). I would totally buy again from them.

            I've been ordering from Asos for years now, probably over 50 times and I've always been very happy with the quality of products and fast shipping. Once my order got lost and never got delivered (it was mainly a problem at the post office) but I issued for a refund through paypal and they refunded me very quickly without ever needing to contact their customer service. I pretty much always find what i'm looking for and Asos is the first place I check. I love that they have so many different brands and lots of variety and different products, also their own Asos-line is fairly good quality and affordable. The catwalk videos really show their products better than any other sites. I don't really understand why they have only two stars, most of the  negative reviews seem to do with customer service and returns, of which I have no experience.. So maybe something for Asos to work on? Overall to me they seem like a very professional company (site works really well. never listing items that are not in stock. no ridiculous discount codes or bribing influencers..)

I therefore contacted them for a replacement to receive the reply that they were now out of stock and I would have to return the the swimsuit i did not want at my own convenience and also keep checking the website MYSELF to see if they came back into stock.

            I see a lot of negative reviews, however i would like to share my positive experience. I ordered at the weekend and expected Wednesday - Items received a day early on Tuesday! I was notified all the time of updates on my order. The clothes I ordered were from ASOS brand instead of the others they sell. I normally shop on places such as missguided and boohoo but because of the price I don't expect much quality wise, so when i ordered Asos's own brand i thought it would be the same with some items having to go back but worth trying on because of the cheap price. However each item I received was such good quality and made form nice thick material they look like they were more expensive. The sizes were also consistent! I am so pleased and have completely been converted to an ASOS customer for my future purchases. I would recommend this company. (L) Thank you Asos for my quick and beautiful clothes - ready for my upcoming holiday! :D

            A month ago I placed an order for a few black summer dresses and paid for express shipping because I needed black clothes urgent. I have just lost a loved one, and where I come from we wear all black for at least a couple of months - I am not a very big fan of all black so I really needed some new clothes to get me by these couple of months. Unfortunately, four weeks on, my order never arrived despite my efforts to raise a flag almost as soon as I placed the order, as I knew that not receiving a tracking link within a few hours was bad news. Anyhow, customer care has apologized and advised me to place a replacement order, which I did. A week later I still haven't received a tracking link or my order. I have tried email but no one is replying. I have tried explaining that I really need black outfits and since apparently they cannot do the simple task of shipping an order, then they should at least give me back my money without further delay so I can go shop for black clothes. Nothing. They don't even care. It has now been a month and they still have my money (more than 200 pounds) and I still don't have any black clothes or money to go shop for some. I have tried being polite, even apologized after writing an angry email. I have tried reasoning with them. I have tried making them understand my situation hoping that they will be more sensitive. Nothing. Still no replies. Still no clothes. Still no refund. Asos online shop is incapable of letting people shop online. It's Russian roulette whether your order will be dispatched and it's a nightmare to get your hard earned money back. I have relied on them and they have let me down twice with no intention of fixing their mistake. Please avoid them. Do not make the same mistake as I did trusting them twice.

            Been reading all those one star reviews and I am surprised by all those bad experiences. Personally I haven't returned anything since I am buying from outside of Europe and return shipping would cost me equal or more than the value of the items I purchased. So if something doesn't fit, I just give it to friends or sell it.They do carry a lot of brands which is always great, and have sales most of the time. Usually orders takes 2-3 days to process and shipping is quite fast so no complain on that.The packing isn't the best (carboard box with some airfilled plastic bags to prevent items from moving around), for clothes or shoes its fine but for items that are more fragile like makeup, they do sometimes come slightly damaged.I love the fact that on the website, they do have short video clips of models wearing the items which gives a better idea of how it fits.Overall I still like them and would still recommend.

            Horrible order processing. I purchased 2 dresses for my graduation ceremony. The first time they delivered me a faulty item, with a noticeable stain at the front side, right at the chest area. I requested for a replacement and they sent me a wrong dress. I contacted the customer service for a second replacement, and was told a new replacement would be delivered to me before my graduation ceremony started. They promised me I would have enough time to receive the dress and try it on. But that dress never arrived. Until I contacted the customer service again, they told me they canceled the order and refunded me my money. They made multiple mistakes when taking the process of my order and made a promise that would never be met. Last contact with the customer service, encountered bad attitude. Wouldn't buy from them ever again.

Having placed an order and paying for next day delivery, as normal, I received updates via email regarding the status of my order. This morning I was able to book a delivery window between 11am and 12midday. 11am came and went.. by 1:30pm still nothing. I have gone back and forth with asos and DPD to be told delivery was attempted at 11:12am. This is a absolute lie! The driver never came! Demi at asos was sooooo unhelpful and I am disgusted by the service I received. I am still waiting for this parcel and as the driver is not in the area, I have been told that he may “reattempt” this delivery that never took place in the first place!!! I order from asos regularly but this has changed everything. I am fuming. Moral of the story: Lying drivers and unhelpful customer service agents.

            Actually I considered it pretty risky ordering from Asos after reading all this negative comments. But I liked two dresses so much I decided to take this risk. Well, it was definitely worth it! The order came one day before the estimated time. One of the dresses was the perfect fit so I decided to keep it, the second one I returned. The return is for free, with very clear instructions. The money is back on my account (again, faster than the estimated time). Definitely recommend ordering from Asos.

            I ordered a pair of Adidas sliders from ASOS and not only did they not come next day delivery (as was paid for) but the parcel turned up with a torn open bag and the box looked like it had been ran over by a truck! When I contacted ASOS to express my displeasure with the state of the way the item was delivered, I basically got told 'it's not our responsibility', yet as the vendor I think it is 100% your responsibility to ensure that your items turn up in a state that a consumer would expect. I don't purchase items with any ounce of expectation that they would be delivered in such a state. I will certainly be looking to shop elsewhere from now on due to this experience!

            My order was for mixed items and one of the sandals that I ordered, had a different shoe inside the packaging, than what I had ordered. I've known Asos auto response ""customer service"" to be quite bad previously but figured that surely, if they mess up on their part, it must be a different story.... WRONG. After a 10 minute chat with ""Ruben"", which included all but copy paste responses, not a single question about what I received nor a single apology for their mistake, I was just told to use their normal return service. bog standard, done. I'm so underwhelmed by their flipping ridiculous 10 wpm ""Customer Service"" right now, I can't even comprehend what just happened. SHOCKING!

            This has to be the most terrible company for customer service. I have had nothing but a horrible experience. I am so upset I don't even know where to begin. They sent me a faulty product, they have absolute rude f********  customer service representatives, they lie about refunds, and they make it their mission to inconvenience you. Please take your experiences to Twitter/FB/IG with the hashtag #AsosCustomerApathy because they don't care and from my experience and observation, they treat their customers with very little regard. My purchase can't be located ironically after I make a complaint and now im being kept from contacting customer care to resolve it. I have had ENOUGH!

            I have ordered some clothes for the very first time on the 6th of May, and I have already received them on the 9th (today) even though there was a long weekend followed by a bank holiday. I don't often write reviews, but I was really surprised by the quickness and quality of the items I have received from ASOS so here I am. All my clothes fit perfectly well after following the size guide on the website which I was the most pleased about, as well as, even though the shirts I've bought weren't expensive at all, their quality and material seem great! Overall, I am very delighted I have found this online clothing store and I will definitely buy most of my clothes from here in the future.

            Ordered a pair of CK jeans, I already have some at home in the same size but these ones were sized up wrong as they were a lot smaller than stated. When I received the jeans I was disgusting by the way they came, the bag was already open on the inside and the jeans were screwed up. Someone else had obviously returned them before me and ASOS didn’t bother folding them back up! The customer services were rude and useless not even an apology. I had ordered sunglasses on a separate occasion and they were scratched when I received them. The way they do returns is beyond a disaster! Have to wait 7 working days for them to recieve item and then another 5 working days to get the money back! But last time it took them almost 14 working days.

            From Denmark. I have ordered several times and the items have fully lived up to my expectations. I had to return a pair of shoes (I have learned that “wide fit” is really wide) and have just received an email that they have returned the money to my account. I think that the “people of your weight and height normally buy this size” feature is pure genius since I would have gotten a size bigger otherwise (and that would have been to big). So all in all just a positive experience :-)

            Recieved a 20% off discount, ordered a pair of shoes that didn’t fit, want to exchange them to the exact same pair, just in a smaller size - not possible.

            Update: My package just up and disappeared I guess because I've yet to see it. On the bright side, ASOS customer service refunded my order after they realized they could not send me a new packaged since the items I ordered were all out of stock. I guess while my experience wasn't great, I'm willing to try ordering again and hoping for no delivery mishaps next time around...!My only regret is that I cannot upload documents and videos on Trust Pilot to offer more credibility for my very negative review. UPS said that my package was delivered 6 days ago. At my university, all the on-campus students' mail go to the mail room, where we go to pick it up. I thought it was strange that I didn't receive an email notifying that my package had arrived. I went to the mailroom and long story short, nothing ever came for me. Nothing under my name, the tracking number, or address. I emailed ASOS customer service telling them that I never received my order. They just sent me a copy-paste message. Okay, understandable-- they listed some valid reasons I might not have gotten my package. Except I had already gone through their list because it's the exact same as the one in their FAQs page. I don't have neighbors (at least not in the traditional sense) and it's impossible for them to pick up my package without my student ID. Not to mention, the mailroom never received a package for me anyway. There is ONE drop-off point for the package as well, no backyards or fences of the sort.I contacted UPS. They threw their hands up in the air and claimed the package was delivered. I don't know how they knew it was delivered when all they did was pass it on to USPS according to the ""track my order"" option on ASOS. Oh, maybe USPS made a mistake on the delivery?I walked into my uni's USPS. They said nope and said to try the main one. I called and guess what? MY TRACKING NUMBER DOESN'T EXIST. The employee was confused because she said they never received such a package to deliver. No USPS could actually, because the number wasn't trackable for them.So my package is in the bermuda triangle I guess. UPS and ASOS says it was delivered. I look at my package-less self and say it most definitely was not. ASOS customer service after rounds of infuriating emails got back and said they'd resend my order. Everything worked ou-- NO. The items I ordered are SOLD OUT. At this point, I just want my darn refund and to cast away the company forever.I can't comment on the quality of the material from ASOS. The ease of shopping was good. But this is the most contrived, ridiculous customer experience of my life and I am most ready to never repeat it again. If you're considering ordering from ASOS, think about why there is a sudden barrage of 1 star reviews and ask yourself if it's worth the risk. Clearly there's bias involved since the most furious customers are the ones giving the most feedback, but at the end of the day, there are clearly some big delivery/customer service issues going on.

Then get a text that morning from ASOS stating that AS REQUESTED my delivery date had been changed to Tuesday 8th May !!!! Customer services are bad and not interested. They told me to contact them if I had not got my order by 10pm  on Tuesday 10th May. Why adverts so next day delivery when you can’t do it. I cancelled my order which is a loss of £50 to my them.

            I made two orders on Asos on the 30th April that were meant to arrive the day before yesterday at the latest (Friday 4th May). When I contacted Customer service they told me it could take up until Wednesday the 16th May for them to arrive for reasons that were ""outside their control."" I told them I needed the items for a holiday and that I didn't understand why it would take so long when Asos had said at checkout that it would arrive on the 4th at the very latest . They told me they would only be able to take ""further steps"" after Wednesday the 16th and so that I should contact them at this date if I still had not received anything. I just found the customer service very poor. The first person I spoke to, ""Denise"" even ended the conversation mid-chat after having disregarded all my comments and telling me that I was ""more than welcome"" to return the items if I wasn't happy they had not arrived on time... I thought that was quite rude. It surprised me a lot.  Quite upset about not only the late delivery but also the poor customer service. Asos do not seem very concerned about their customers and expect them to just deal with their delivery problems passively. Asos, It is a little bit unprofessional to tell the customer that the reasons for the late delivery are ""out of your control."" Maybe you should take responsibility, instead of blaming a more-than-two week delay on your carrier?  I contacted customer service for a solution and an answer to why I had not got what I had paid for, but instead I received some sassy comments from your customer service. Kind of uncalled for...

            Worst service ever! Was on holiday with my wife and looking forward our trip! So I ordered matching t-shirts to wear with my wife. The delivery was never received on time and when I complained all they could say wait till 10pm, so I waited till 10pm and ask them again. Now they are saying wait till next week till receive my item. Also only compensation they could offer me was 10% discount only last one month! I could get that discount from my friends student discount. So disappointed in there service. ( ordered item on Wednesday and they only sent the item on Saturday to be delivered.) Never using this company ever again. Thank you for ruining my holiday.

            Have been an avid customer since its start-up and in the recent years Asos has grown immensely, unfortunately their customer service has not.Still no direct contact number to call, a live chat that is now available but you'll only be at the receiving end of generic and computerised responses, twitter has a delayed response too-and they seem to have backlog of customer  tweets to reply to rather than instance responses. Not good enough in this day and age with all the technological advancement!Further, when you purchase the last item (and then its gone out of stock) they end up sending you the incorrect item rather than notifying you its out of stock (guess to save them the hassle?) which then means you're left with the burden to returning an item you didn't place and don't care for? this has happened to me at least 4 times on occasions-and its definitely not a coincidence.On the live chat I requested that somebody from customer service call me so I can discuss regarding the mistakes made in my previous orders, they said somebody would call me within 24 hours. 4 weeks later, and yet still no call?Not good enough Asos-and you know it!

            I don't know how I did live before i came across this company a few years ago. I absolutely love it! I have been buying from them every month, sometimes  every week, as i am a terrible shopaholic and fashionista The items  usually delivered in 2-3 days, hermes couriers send me their updates all of the time. If I don't like something I return it free of charge and the shop is just next door to my house, so it takes me only a couple of minutes to return. Refunds are made in one week to ten days and I have never ever had a single issue with that. I even don't pay with my card until I receive my item and I am entirely happy with it, as I use Klarna payment (such a great option!). I am not a big fun of ASOS brand itself ( I did try and did order it before and there  was always something not to my liking - would not fit properly, did not like the material, ect), but they sell my favourite brands and all my Moschino, Versace, Ralph Lauren were purchased via ASOS website. Their app is great and very convenient, as it allows to tick my favourite items, keep an eye on them when the price goes down, it did allow me to get some fantastic bargains. I also collect points which then turn into vouchers and I can spend them to buy more stuff. I was very surprised to see all these negative reviews in here.. I guess we all have different experience. But i think I have placed more then 100 orders with them and nothing ever went wrong. If there was a small issue, it always have been resolved to the best for me. So I highly recommend this company, as I trust it 200% and i promise you nobody paid me for this feedback, lol. Thank you, ASOS!x

            Shopped with ASOS for years - have been sent damaged items on countless occasions, along with the wrong size, the wrong item or have had items missing. Customer services is beyond a joke, and you’ll get a completely different answer by phoning than you will by emailing, though no one ever has a solution, or apologises for issues with an order. Wasted a lot of money calling them only to be told there was nothing they could do. Besides the fact they are unreliable and rude, I have also discovered that they charge more for the petite range because ‘they are manufactured differently’. The only advice they could give is to order from the normal range, which, if you wear a UK 2 isn’t an option. Disgusted by the discriminatory prices but they get away with it because so few places stock small sizes.

            I ordered from Asos without checking Trust Pilot first, which was completely out of character for me recently as I've been looking for bridesmaids dresses for my wedding in August!!So after I ordered I realised what I'd done and came straight here to read reviews.. my heart dropped :( the reviews don't seem too great on the most part; delayed or missing orders, rude customer service, wrong items or size - it goes on! However, panic aside, I thought there was nothing I could do but wait - and hope! I have been so impressed! My order came within 3 days, all the updates from Hermes kept me in the loop and I just love the dresses!! One of my BM is calling tonight to try hers on, the other one will get to try hers at the weekend.So up to now everything's been great, and the dresses went into the sale from £85 to £34, with a further 10% off at checkout, which was a fantastic bit of luck for me and my fiance. I just need to keep my fingers crossed that they fit now for a perfect result ☺☺

            DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU REQUIRE YOUR ORDER TO ARRIVE WHEN THEY SAY IT WILL. I ordered my brother some holiday clothes for his birthday present. The delivery date was to be the 26th April. My brother was due to fly on the evening of the 27th. I ordered 3 t shirts and 2 pair of shorts for him and ASOS said they would arrive on or before the 26th April. Their parcel deliver arm HERMES text ot say delivery on the 26th at 12-4pm. Then another message to say 1pm-5pm. Then no message at all to there would be no delivery! I had arranged to see my brother that night. to give him his holiday clothes. I contacted ASOS on the 27th who apologised and said delivery would be that day and the item was yet to be dispatched to Hermes (despite their online tracking which said it had been dispatched to the courrier on the 26th). Same situation on the 27th. 12-4pm delivery. Then 1-5pm delivery. Nothing arrived at 5pm so my brother said he would just have to buy more clothes when he got to his holiday. Delivery was then on the 30th at 3pm. I asked ASOS for a discount of compensation for wasting my time by waiting in for delivery. They refused and said on occasion they had problems delivering items.

            Very poor customer service. I rang the online help number to which I found very unhelpful, I then noticed I had been charged 28 pound for the call, I am a student on part time wages and this is a disgrace. Why does such a big company need to charge this for customer service calls?

            Hello,Asos has very poor customer service. I work myself in a customer service setting and it is clear that this company does not go the extra mile for their customers and hide behind their procedures.I placed two orders and used the 50 euros discount of 200 euros promotion at the end of March.I send for both orders a few items back ending up below the 200 euros. When I ordered I read the small print and I was under the impression, that if you refund things and you dip under the used promo offer but still fall in the next available promo offer, the discount would be adjusted appropriately.In the email I received in which the refund was processed it states the following:**	If a discount was applied to your original order, the amount refunded will be adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level.	This is very misleading. ""adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level."" To me this means the discount level will be revised to the lower available discount and not fully removed. Needless to say, I was disappointed that I lost the 50 euros discount fully.But then I realized that with one of the 2 orders, I would loose the 50 euros discount and that the 37 euros dress I send back, would have a zero refund. Due to this misleading promo/promo wording.Logically I asked for the dress to be send back to me, since I send it back for nothing, something I obviously would not have done, was it more clear that I would not get ""adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level."" and was told this is not possible and I was given a standardized answer.Nothing stands in the way, to send out this dress again. Especially since when I signed up, I paid for a full year free shipping as well.When I asked for a supervisor or manager, I was told to contact the general email address/visit the general help section on the website.I only signed up recently and spend like 330 euros on a few orders, but needless to say, with this level of customer service and with the way they run their promotions, I will take my business elsewhere.Please be very careful when using the promotions and better ask customer service before you refund anything how much you will get actually refunded.

            I am extremely unsatisfied with my most recent ASOS experience. They sent TWO articles of clothing that were mislabled (one was an 18 mislabled as a 14 when I ordered a 10...) and it took over 30 days for my package to arrive - their return/exchange policy is 28 days...so when I tried to get a refund, they said no because I had the product past their return/exchange policy which is RIDICULOUS. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. I am never shopping with ASOS again.

            Much choice, free shipping to the Netherlands above 25 euros, delivery a few days later then average. So not a good option if you need something fast! Another problem is that it is quite difficult to return an item, so keep that in mind.Will definitely use this website again to shop! :)

            This company is a fraudulent Conning companyThey have made me pay for next day delivery I waited in all day yesterday I even have security cameras and a security officer to confirm no Asos delivery came here yesterday. They lied and said they came here at 5:05 when I had a delivery from Amazon at that time then when I spoke to their head office they turned around and told me they only deal with business I went to speak to customer services customer services said they don’t know who the carrier is so how are you making people pay for next day delivery and you’re not 100% certain that it’s been delivered I thought is a fortune and company do not use them they’re not 100% certain and customer service is awful

            Absolutely terrible customer service and commerce.  I ordered a pair of shoes size 8, received size 9.  I received the shoe and was forced to pay $30 in duty, of which I was not ever told I would have to pay. only to find out the new pair was ALSO the wrong size.Save your time, go to a store and buy your clothes/shoes...Asos is clearly incapable of running a legitimate business with functioning warehousing, shipping or customer service departments.  I will never buy from it again, and would never recommend it to anyone.

            Terrible service. I specifically ordered from the US website to ensure that I wouldn’t get hit with a customs fee due to the items coming from the UK. Lo and behold I get hit with a whopping $68CAD customs fee. I contact them to find out why this happened they said that despite the fact that I ordered from the American site sometimes items ship from the warehouse in the UK and somehow that’s my fault. Not to mention the quality of the items, I bought a pair of pants and within days there’s stitching coming out and holes everywhere. Will not be giving this company any more business. Speak with your wallets.

            I was very worried to order from ASOS because of all the reviews BUT I don't regret! I loved my dress!!! quality is really good an exactly like the picture. Now, a few things to take into consideration:1. If you need it for a special occasion, order fast shipping. I had it shipped to Vancouver, BC and it was here 4 days after I purchase it. Most of the bad reviews are based on not having items delivered on time so to be safe just pay for express shipping, it's only $15 CAD.2. DUTY EXPENSES. They charged me $22 for duty taxes which is not that bad compared to other things I have ordered before. I don't know if it depends on the total $ of your order but mine was around $75 with express shipping.

            I wish I could give them zero stars. They offer international delivery, but refuse to be responsible for it.They give no tracking info. Well over a month past the delivery date and every time I get in touch with customer service they ask me to verify my address (4 times now) and tell me to check my doorstep and ask my neighbors.In my country you have to sign for packages and present an ID, so they're really not interested in customer service.

            The worst customer service ever!I've faced extremely rude customer service on ASOS!They notified me that one of the items (pants) in my order is apparently out of stock and they refunded me. But the thing is that I've ordered a combination of a blazer and pants and I don't need a blazer without pants!! However, they decided to proceed with my order even if mandatory part of it is missing. And then they just sent me a notification how sorry they are! No discount, nothing! We I've tried to cancel my order via so called live chat I've faced very rude attitude fro the support agent Sofia (chat number:‎13015863). She was so unprofessional and rude that I decided to take some time to register here and leave a feedback. I've never faceв an attitude like this anywhere! I asked why ASOS haven't informed me about the change. I mean who needs only the half of the suit? Her response was: We deliver a lot of orders around the world, we don't have time to inform every customer! Who ever says this to anyone?????? And what am I if not a client then? She should have given me some robot-like answers because even this would be better! She also said that they have very few employees to do stuff like this! She has not given me any direct answers and was acting like she wants me to back off. When I said that she is incompetent and asked for a senior manager she told me to be polite and calm down!!! Literally!!! This is absolutely unacceptable! ASOS, if you reading this, you better fire her...

            As far as online shopping goes this App is probably the easiest process and most trouble free it can be.I ordered a leather jacket and being in-between sizes i was unsure what size to order, the price meant i could not afford to purchase 1 in each size so i ordered the 1. You guessed it, i ordered the wrong size but the returns policy is very straight forward.Slip enclosed for the return, notified when ASOS had received my parcel back and then notified again when my exchange was being re-shipped.Excellent service and highly recommend.

If you can AVOID DPD delivery if your closest is Dagenham. Anyway, this time the past 2 days I've been on the phone to ASOS and each time spoken to someone new, they've all been brilliant trying to solve the issue. They've all called DPD for me and questioned what on earth they're playing at and each time got a bit closer to retrieving my parcel haha. They've been fab. Long story short the DPD moron delivered my parcel a mile away from my house o.O the person even signed for it!!! He was then meant to pick it back up at 3pm yesterday and deliver lastnight...obviously didn't, called ASOS again at 8am where I spoke to a lovely lady who again called DPD to ask what's going on and I should get my parcel today!!!!Fingers crossed 😂

            Shocking customer service at ASOS.  I basically received a £5 voucher to be used from ASOS for customer loyalty... pah!  I went online and placed an order but it failed to complete.  When I tried to reorder and use the voucher it said it had since been used, clearly it hadn't as the prior order failed to complete.  When chatting with the customer service agent(s), they treat you like a criminal asking for screenshots to be sent, eventhough its clear as day on the profile that the voucher had been redeemed with no order complete.  Stay away from ASOS, they treat you poorly, don't know what loyalty is.  Time to defect to other brands that actually know what customer care means!

            I recently had a terrible experience with customer service. I sent two tops back to exchange into smaller sizes, however as they didn't have a smaller sizes in stock they proceeded to give me a refund. The tops were worth £40 however I only received a £10 refund. Perplexed I called the customer service team and apparently because I used a discount code they could only offer me a refund of £10 which is ridiculous. I asked them to send me the tops back as I didn't intend to get a refund I was merely asking for an exchange but they said this wasn't possible. I feel like I have been robbed of £30. The terms and conditions are not clearly communicated. This has been a terrible experience and I am questioning if I'll ever shop on ASOS again.  I've read a couple of reviews further down and it seems lots of people are having the same issue, I review of your processes is definitely needed.

            If I could give zero I would. Extremely awful customer service placed an order for a dress I wanted and was told after waiting one week for my item to arrive that there was a problem with the courier they has used (Hermes) and I would have to wait up to another week for my dress to arrive. I waited until the said date and went on to track my order to see that my item was on its way back to Asos from the Hermes sorting hub. I contacted asos again to be told there was nothing they could do and i would be automatically refunded within 5 days of the warehouse receiving my order and that I could just order another on the site. This was all very good but the dress I had ordered in now out of stock. Asos you have shocking customer service and you have lost a customer for life I will not be using you again.

            I honestly cannot fault ASOS customer service, they have been extremely helpful, I bought 6 bridesmaids dresses a year ago for my wedding this June and noticed 2 dresses had different colour embellishment to the other 4 dresses, as you can imagine I panicked & ordered new dresses, I emailed customer service and they advised I could send them back for inspection to which I did as they still had the tags in, they refunded me for the dresses, so helpful & kind of them to give me the option of returning them, 100% excellent customer service by all assistants I dealt with especially Julius, thank you.

            Worst Return ServicesI returned my dress a month ago and have not received the refund or the confirmation from ASOS. I reached out to their customer services after waited for two weeks, and they told me someone else would contact me. And two weeks after (today), I still didn't receive any emails from them, so I contacted them again. I was told to show them ""a proof of postage"". I had a big order, so a pre-paid return label was included. I used that one and drop the return package in the UPS office. What would the ""proof"" be?! I online shop a lot, and it's the first time I was questioned if I was lying about the return. Very disappointed.

            I have never written a review for a website, and I online shop like crazy. ASOS is the best website and customer service I have ever encountered. I just began shopping with them about a month ago and I have already made two orders. A few items in my second order did not fit, the return is so easy and completely free. Once they got my return (about a week from the time I sent it back,) they sent me an email keeping me posted on getting my return, what the items were, how much will be returned to my card and in how many days. They make online shopping, and the most annoying part- returns- SO simple. Very pleased with this site and I will be ordering from them again. Not to mention, their clothes are amazing!

            Very happy with their delivery speed (ordering from Croatia), right sizes and overall impression! I’ve waited no longer than 5 days for my 3 dresses to arrive and I was very pleased when I opened the package. They looked almost the same as on the model, they were all safely wrapped and they were all a perfect fit. While waiting for the dresses, I also had a tracking service sent to me by e-mail which made it super easy for me to track my package. Great service and very nice clothes! Definitely will be ordering again in the future!

            The bride picked a dress off this site for all the bridesmaids to wear in her wedding, I being one of them. Each of us ordered the dress on the same day and mine was the only one that didn't come on time. Given that it is impossible to chat to a live person at ASOS, I opted to use the live chat option. I was told to wait 3 weeks before contacting them again for ""postal delays"" and when I expressed concern with this given that I needed the dress 2 months from now at the LATEST, they were vague in response and never directly addressed the issue. The only direct response I could get was to wait the 3 weeks and they would ""look into it."" When I continued to push the issue the customer service rep ended the chat on me. Absolutely horrible service. I will not be shopping here again.

            I have been shopping at Asos for about 5 years now. The only problem I had ever had was they sent me the wrong dress in 2014. Since then I've bought something probably 2 times a month and it always comes when they estimate it as well as I track it and its always on time.  Everything else is perfect as well.

            It’s a great page to find different clothing pieces. And that’s the only good thing. For days now all I have is problem with them. I have never expirences wkrse costumer service.First of all you only have options of a chat( which just goes off and you can’t longer write messages and no one bother to contact you) then email and Facebook. You can not personally speak to someone.On Wednesday  I became a prime delivery member just so I would receive and important gift by Saturday. Well I received 2/3 pieces that I ordered the third were women shoes instead of a man T-shirt. I contacted them immediately and they lady I “texted” with said I am sorry but mistakes happen you can have that order in a week. I explained that I don’t need it in a week but tomorrow and that that’s why I paid 15€ shipping all she said is I m sorry but that’s all I can offer you. I said I wanna cancel that since now I have to go and personally buy a T-shirt and she said you will only get your refund when you return us the shoes. So let me be clear I pay next day shipping I wait at home for the order it came wrong and they offered no help instead I now have to due to their mistake go to the post office send them a package so I will get the money back for the T-shirt that I never got. I was so foolish to order again from them, this time the delivery arrived when I wasn’t at home and they left it’s at some laundry place that’s 30 min away from me. I spent two days trying to communicate to them that it’s not ok to deliver something so far and that if I had time to go around for things I wouldn’t be ordering online, the answer from them was that If i don’t pick it up they ll take it back and it will be a couple of weeks to get my money back. So pretty much just bad and awful experiences with ASOS. I have never written a review before but this company makes me so angry. I became a premium member to be able to receive my orders next day and all I have is wrong orders or orders delivered far from my house. The worst thing is that they don’t care about their costumers, at all! I happen to know a thing or two about online sales and how other company handle it and the attention they give to their costumer satisfaction. If I could rate them with 0 I would!

            I've never had major issues with the company until my last order. They had an offer and depending on the amount of your order you could have used a promo code for a discount. GIMME50 GIMME75 GIMME100My total allowed me to use GIMME100. Some of the clothes didn't fit and I needed to return them. Instead of calculating the discount for each item (including the ones that I kept - the majority) before refunding they completely removed the discount, taking it off the refund. Other than being not fair, since the discount applied to all of the items, they wouldn't even recalculate the discount for the new amount. ""Our policy doesn't allow us to do so"". As their policy was imposed on them by some other entity.ASOS always seemed to me a company very similar to Amazon, which tries to establish a long term trust with its users, so to become the first choice today and in the future. This was an unprofessional move and they won't see me back. Just sent a request to delete my account as well. I might be just another customer, but you're just another retail website in an ocean of options.Good luck.

            I ordered shoes for a wedding, paid for faster shipping 2days before wedding I contacted ASOS who assured me shoes would arrive next day so I didn't get alternative shoes, next day arrived no shoes, ASOS were less than helpful said they'd refund or send new shoes the next week. Neither of which were of any help to me with a wedding the next morning. Requested refund which I got for items but not shipping sent another email to get my shipping no apologies and then I lost money (€4.08) due to currency exchanges ok not a huge amount but I guess €4 to discover a site is rubbish is a small price to pay.

            Havent shopped here for a while yet again delivery is appauling, items now 4 days late and all anyone can say wait another 5 days. Royal mail said item received on tracking but they are still waiting for something from them and now order is still stuck at the mail centre. Neither Asos nor Royal Mail can advise where my parcel is and if not received in 5 days its deemed as lost, yet this is the second time its happened and the reason for me not shopping there. No contact number for them and chat is useless, iv also emailed them and no response. I believe Asos are not been upfront about the delivery times and are misleading customers.

I have already addressed my issue with them and they don't want to admit their mistake and wanted me to wait for another 2 weeks. Customer service wasn't helpful at all and kept on saying the same thing. Now that I don't need the dresses and it didn't arrived when I needed it and asking for a refund and they don't want to make any refund on my account.

I’ll be reaching out to these brands to check their account holders selling their product. How do I do this? Easy, social media. They’re putting their brands reputation on the line with the angry audience ASOS has captured.

            Horrible experience! Ordered a bra. Got sent a top. Customer service sent it out again and guess what, I received the same top! I had had enough by this point so just excercised my right to a refund so I could purchase elsewhere. But they were holding my money captive until they had the tops back in their possession which I'mPretty sure is illegal as I haven't received what I paid for AND I didn't technically have to return the tops at all, as they were delivered to me, with my name on the parcel, they fall under unsolicited goods. But I did want to return the tops, but it takes time to process the refund, which they wouldn't do until they were physically back in their possession, (so would have to wait for it to get to them), they broke consumer contract law here by making my refund of the incorrect item conditional on ther physical possession of the incorrect goods. Customer service were downright nasty. I asked them why they weren't following consumer contract regulations and they kept bleating about their own 'policy'. Well sorry asos but your policy doesn't override the LAW! I informed them of this, but all I got back was 'it's not our policy' Staff were downright awful to deal with throughout the whole situation!

            I order from Asos ALL the time - it’s my first port of call for online shopping because they carry so many brands. I have the premier delivery, I have order things at 10:30pm and it has been delivered at 9:30am the next day - less than 12 hour turn around is unbelievable! They also have a points system so the more you spend, the more points you receive and then you get a £5 voucher when you get 500 points which is awesome. Most of the negative reviews seem to be from international shipping problems but I’m UK based so I’ve never experienced any problems - if anything it’s better than any other company I order from!

            I ordered a suit for prom and I noticed it was heading to a wrong address in a different state. As any person would I panicked and quickly tried to navigate to a contact page, however there is no call center and by the time an agent responds it’s apparently to late to do anything. I asked the agent, Ashley, to speak to a manager or supervisor and she said that it was impossible as there were none available. Who is in charge? Monkeys? Aliens? Robots? Who knows, because it’s been 2 days and I still have yet to find out. She said to contact the carrier. I then received an email address from Ashley to be able speak to someone else named Joe in the company, which as far as I know isn’t any position higher than Ashley. I was told they cannot cancel an order even tho it hasn’t left the facility and for 11hrs it sat there in there warehouse but couldn’t be stopped! Thus far  there’s no management team, no control over or communication ability between company and warehouse and no call center. At this point I’m done dealing with ASOS, so I call the delivery company and asked to have the package rerouted or returned and they very nicely by the way, amazing customer service, say I they need to be called by ASOS because only the shipper can request those things. I thank the lady and email ASOS again stating that they have the ability to cancel or reroute and all they have to do is contact the delivery company that was expecting a call from them to correct this mistake-turned-nightmare. I then receive an email from a different man from ASOS named Andrew, who basically says despite the fact that the delivery company says that they certainly do have the ability to reroute or cancel an order and are anticipating a call from them that they basically cannot help me and that there’s no way to cancel. Which makes me wonder if anyone in that company cares about its customers or owns a phone?! As of now I’m still waiting for a reply and I most likely will not be able to have this beautiful suit for prom and the package is being delivered to a random person who hopefully will enjoy it as I payed for it with my hard earned dollars. Terrible experience and goes to show that there’s nothing there willing to do to help a customer.

            I LOVE ASOSI have ASOS primer delivery, they never fail to deliver the next day!I have had problems in the past where I have needed to contact somebody. I find this is easiest by tweeting (and on direct message) on twitter and also facebook! Replies are so fast.I ordered a pair of high heeled boots for £40 and unfortunately they got very scratched after one night of wearing them. (This is unusual because normally everything from ASOS is such great quality). I messaged customer services on twitter and they told me to return the item and put it down as faulty. I returned and got my money back!They originally offered to send me a new pair but they were sold out so I was fully refunded. This was so quick and easy to sort out, I have no idea why people experience so many problems. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!! <3

            Would rate 0 stars! Online chat customer service people are rude. Estimated delivery is poo! I ordered something 4 days ago, it says I should have come in 3. I explained this to one girl on there and she says to email them at 10pm so I emailed at 10 to have terms and conditions wrote out to me. Someone telling me about my card and date of birth. Then to be told I should wait until Friday to receive it then no sorry “double checked, get back to us if you’ve not received it by the 18th” nearly 2 weeks after it was purchased!!! So much for 3 days and there so called estimated delivery. Quick enough to take your money though 😂 as always. Won’t be ordering ever again.

            Super easy using the app, quick delivery (I bought the 2 day shipping for a year), returns are always super easy with the return label and the plastic bag is made to flip inside out and you can re-use it easily. Good communication from the ASOS team when you buy items or return items. 10/10 - highly recommend!

            I love ASOS' selection, they have free shipping and great payment options. Big minus for me is having to pay for the return, it's quite expensive from Norway. I contacted ASOS about getting my return fee refunded, and he told me that would be no problem! He told me to hold onto the chat reference number, so I could get the money back. He was lovely!Later, I spoke with a woman in the chat. She was utterly rude! She talked to me like I was stupid, you have to f***ing understand that I'm asking you BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER!!! She told me there was no way I could get my money back. I rarely experience service this poor, one telling me one thing and then the other being rude and telling me something different!It has put me off wanting to buy anything else.

            Extremely annoyed with ASOS! I ordered a pair of shoes size UK 4 to be delivered to Singapore. Firstly I had to pay $40 duties for them, when the arrived they sent me size 6 US, which is a 3UK. When I contacted  CS, I was told that I had picked the wrong size even though I have been ordering size UK4 shoes on ASOS all the time!! Then she refused to give me an Exchange as I’m in Singapore  and told me I had to return the item and reorder. NO WHERE on their product page did it say that the brand was actually US and used US sizing and that you were suppose to choose from US sizing. Further to this I was told that I had to go to the US site to actually find out what the US size was for these shoes!!! Their size conversion is completely wrong for US shoe sizes. When I told them this, they were adamant that they had got it right.   Appalling and unhelpful customer service!!!i was a loyal shopper with ASOS and even continued shopping with them after moving to SG. But I’m no longer going back to them!

            Just had the worst customer service experience of my life. Shipped my order. Didn’t arrive the day it was supposed to. Told it would be the next day. I delay a trip away by a day so I can collect items, which were needed for a shoot. The next day when the items were due to arrive, ASOS emails me thanking me for returning the items and they’ll be refunding me. Ummmm. I didn’t return the items. I didn’t even receive the items. I’ve now lost a day of my trip but also no longer have the items (three tee shirts) for a shoot. After three failed attempts to find someone to talk to on the live chat (one person bailed on me before I could even type anything. They saw the order number and clearly knew they messed up and didn’t want to deal with it), I spoke to ‘Chloe’ who apologised for their mistake but there was nothing they could do. They value me as a customer and want me to be happy. The emptiest of empty corporate responses. Having bought from ASOS for years and years. And recommended friends to use them when they weren’t well known, I regret giving them my loyalty and money over the years. They’re too big to give a damn. It’s sad, ASOS used to be great. Should point out I live in london, UK. Easy place to deliver to and communicate with someone. They did neither. Appalling brand and customer service. Actually impressive how dreadful this experience was.

            I placed an order for $154, two minutes after I realized there was a code for a free two-day shipping if you spend over $120. I thought it's going to be automatically applied since that made more sense but I needed to enter the code. I contacted customer service and asked if my order can be shipped express since I spent over $120 so I don't have to cancel and re-order and the rep said ""there is nothing we can do, your order is scheduled for standard shipping"" It was just a small thing that I asked for and they wouldn't bother to help. I worked in an online business and shipping and I know that is something that could've been done.  Such a bad customer service and I don't know if I want to order again from a company that doesnt have good customer service.

            I just had the WORST experience.  I  updated the shipping and billing address on my account since moving to a new country.  I purchased 2 items and saw in my confirmation email that they billed my new billing address but are shipping to my old address.  I spoke to their customer support via chat and was told that since 1 hour had past since my order was purchased, they could not check on the shipping address or update it and it will just have to be sent to the one in the confirmation email.  This was THEIR mistake and they were not willing to check and make sure it's sent to the address I had updated on my account.  I don't know who lives at my old address and how do I know they won't take the package? I didn't want to cancel, I just wanted to make sure they update the address.  I can't believe that they had a mistake and wouldn't do anything.  They said my option was to either purchase AGAIN and I hope the same mistake doesn't happen, and also hope that whoever gets my package will say they're not me and send it back.  WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT? I'm a loyal customer for YEARS and this is the first time I've seen a glitch in their online shopping flow.  This happened just over 1 hour from me purchasing, and they said there is nothing they can do.

            At first I was annoyed because I ordered a bikini top AND bottom but received two bottoms. That was strike one. Then, I returned both items because the bottoms I ordered didn't fit and of course I didn't need the other bottom. The second strike was that I was only refunded for one of the items. Luckily, I emailed customer service and they got back to me right away. They made sure I was refunded for my total purchase. I really appreciate how fast they responded and took action. I'm also glad they include the free return shipping label -- that's awesome! So, thank you to Karis from ASOS customer service for helping me out. :)

            Terrible online chat customer service. I didn't' receive my student promotion code email. So I started chatting online with Aaron. He asked for a picture of my student ID with expiration date on it. I took a picture of my student ID and send to him. Then I asked why I have to do this. I don't feel comfortable of sending my ID. Then he just quit!!! End the chat after I send his my ID. Then I started chat again, another guy. I asked why Aaron quit chat after I send him my ID. He didn't say anything, but just ask me send him my ID again. I send again with my photo covered. He said he need the picture of ID without any information covered. He said my information is safe with them. I said Facebook said the same thing. I said the picture has both my name and expiration date on it uncovered. He said he cannot help me anymore. Without my student ID with full information they cannot give my student discount. Fine. That's totally terrible.

            Hi Team, I am concerned as the last four orders I have placed with ASOS have seen items that seem to be too small being sent.  At first I panicked thinking that I have gained A LOT of weight as I have had weight issues, but then I had a friend who is an AUS 10/12 try it and it fit her perfectly, albeit the sleeves were still a bit small in some of the items. I am a size AUS18 and it seems like your clothing sizes have shrinked massively.The dresses I ordered in orders no. 317933792 & no. 316936444 were so small that my size 10 friend could fit into them.Previous to that Order No. 306884879 & No. 306121609 where also returned due to clothes not fitting properly.If you have changed the sizing of your clothing, please let everyone know because a supposedly size 18 item fitting a size AUS 10/12 body is very wrong.Please advise if you have changed your sizings. As a larger lady, I love the ASOS Plus size brands and Asos Curve, but it is not a nice feeling ordering something in that section, receiving it and it's too small not because you have gained weight but because sizings have been changed. It really leaves a sour taste and makes you feel like rubbish. especially if you are someone struggling with weight.I also started a chat conversation in which the agent wasn't helpful at all. Please look into this too. I have attached screenshots of the conversation.  She made me feel VERY awkward and she wasn't at all friendly. ---------------------------------------------She then proceeded to respond to the above email complaint I sent with a scripted message and I told her, that ""​I would like you to pass this message on to someone else since you are the person in the chat service who didn't actually help. I have worked in a customer service centre and I am sure it's unethical of you to take on a case that s about you. Forward my email to a manager and I will await their response."" She didn't pass it on and I sent another email asking for help and she sent the same scripted response but just changed the name in it. Can someone actually assist me or it this how you train for customer care people???

            Their payment processing is terrible and when I had to go back to ""order again"" the order disappears and you have to re-add everything to the shopping cart. Even though I ordered before a promo code expired, because of the payment issue, when I had to reorder, the promo code wouldn't work. They wouldn't do anything to assist a customer. I will NEVER order from ASOS again. When there are so many online clothing companies looking to help, this one says FU to it's customers.

            ASOS sent me the wrong item, when I contacted them they agreed to resend the item however when it arrived it was the wrong item again. When I contacted them they said they would again resend and would confirm within 24hours. 24 hours later they contacted me to say it was no longer in stock so unlucky me and i would need to return the two incorrect items they sent me in order for me to get my money back on an item I didn't get. Each time I contacted customer service I was responded to by a different member of staff so there was no coherency in the conversation. Literally don't care about the customer loosing out for their mistakes. Sad when a company gets to that size where it no longer cares about the customer experience.

            It’s fair to say I shall never use asos’ services again, nor would I recommend them to anybody. I order a suit two weeks before an event I needed it for, however they sent the suit 2 sizes too big. So I sent it back and had requested for them to send me back the correct size before the event, they told me that this was an acceptable request and they would try to achieve this. The day before the event (the day I had given them to send me the suit jacket) and I had not heard any email to say they could not do the request, which they couldn’t because it had not came. So I decided, to re-order the jacket on next day delivery. However, the jacket they had sent this time was a size too small. This was completely unacceptable in my opinion, not only had they sent the wrong item twice but also gave extremely slow return service. To follow on from this, they told me they would give me a refund on my next delivery immediately. Which they have never done. As well as this, they said they would give me a 15% discount code, which in my opinion is an embarrassment of an apology considering they had a 20% offer on for all students. So I would be able to use a bigger discount from being a student then their discount for their horrendous service. For anybody even contemplating using their services I would advise you not to and just pay that extra bit for a reliable service else where.

Customer services kept cutting me off on live chat even though the second error proved my worries correct. Terrible experience, quicker and easier to go to the shops. Delivery charges refunded (although we'll have to see if that actually happens) but even after all the hassle and the mistakes that was the best they could do apparently.

            The worst customer service in the world. Their agents don't listen, it does not matter what you told previously or you ask, they repeat the same policy that blame their customers or couriers making them responsible for everything. They misinform and waste your time unable to offer any solution. I was told that I should talk with ParcelConnect to figure out my tracking number. I spent hours calling and writing them for discover that since I used an ASOS return label, ASOS is who generated the tracking number instead ParcelConnect. I was told ParcelConnect may be able to give me a copy of my receipt what again was not true, etc, etc.Summarizing if you send a parcel through ParcelConnect using an ASOS return label scanned by Payzone anyone keep record. They have poor IT systems that apparently generate unique tracking numbers associated to unique order numbers randomly, and even when their customers pay and buy online, in 2018, instead saving all their relevant information in the cloud or in the website, they can only offer a small piece of paper printed by a third party, as warranty to them. Terrible customer experience and useless customer service.

            First time, and might be the last time I use this webshop. My order was supposed to be delivered today. I contact the customer support chat that tells me to just wait since it's on its way. I contact DHL, and they could immediately tell me that they have not even received the package from ASOS and I will not get it today as it was estimated. If DHL get it from ASOS today I might be lucky and get it sometime next week, otherwise I will wait even longer... Since it was a gift it was important it arrived on time and before the holidays.

            We have had a 10-year-long relationship and they have never disappointed me once. If you're looking for a fabulous dress I guarantee you will find more than one. All my items have been pure joy. The only dangerous thing is you keep wanting more and more.

            I bought 179 dollars worth of stuff from ASOS for the first time. I qualified for two day shipping. I kept getting emails and text updates  telling me exactly where my package was and it arrived right on time! I was so nervous about the quality of the clothes bc I had never shopped here before. I have to say I'm more than impressed! I'm plus size so it's hard for me to find clothes that fit with good quality thick material and ASOS impressed me. Their stuff looks and feels well made and it fit beautifully. Every single thing with my first order went beautifully! I'm so happy! I'm sorry for everyone who has a bad experience, but if you're new to the site like me I would definitely try it and don't let the comments scare you!

            Why are the ratings so low? I’ve always had great experiences with ASOS. I’ve bought a couple dresses, a jacket and a pair of vans  throughout the years and it’s always been a smooth transaction. I get my stuff quick and it look and feels great! Especially being a curvy girl with a small top, their sizing is pretty much true to size, if not giving an inch or two.

            Awful delivery and customer service. I placed a order and waited to receive my email to say it was ready for collection. When i went to the store it wasn't there and this has happened another 3 times since. The tracking for this parcel is a joke from the 5th of this month to today i am still receiving emails to say my parcel is out for delivery. I have contacted customer service 2 times and they haven't been any help at all. I think it's disgusting that you cannot actually speak to someone on the phone like other company's, it makes the whole process harder. I was told i would be contacted about a refund within 48 hours which still hasn't happened. All i want is my money back, the items i ordered were for a party which has been and gone. I will never shop with Asos again which is a shame because it was always a firm favourite of mine.UPDATE:I have finally got my refund after contacting @Asosheretohelp on Twitter who were very helpful

            ASOS had a tech fault and cancelled my order without notifying me. No email in my junk OR inbox - I check both everyday for work emails. However, the money did come out of my PayPal account and I DID receive 2 emails saying My order WAS placed and that my order would be with me in a few days - so obviously I’m going to think my order is placed and it’ll be with me in a few days. Crazy thought process I know..The day before the parcel was due, I went on my ASOS account and saw it said “cancelled”. So I had to chase the CS team about my order and ask ASOS if my order was still coming? Because, again, I had 2 emails telling me the order was placed and it would be with me by Saturday. So this was totally news to me!! The huge inconvenience for me was that the items in the order were for my Mum’s birthday and I had used a 20% code at the time of ordering - which was now expired. I had ordered them at the start of the week to come on or before Saturday - in time for her birthday. But saw it was cancelled on Friday (the day before delivery). I spoke to the CS team via Online Help Chat and I was told ASOS had a tech glitch. I was told to “Just order all items again” - but the items I initallly ordered were now out of stock and now would not be here in time for my Mum’s birthday. The CS team via Online Help Chat assured me tech glitches are extremely rare - but in the same breath, they said I should’ve been checking my Inbox and Junk for emails telling me they had cancelled my order? Which again - was an email I never received in my Inbox or Junk - I double checked. The only emails I received were confirmation emails that the Order was placed, and another with the date it would arrive. Anyway, the only consolation I was offered - despite them confirming the tech issue was on their side - was to get the 20% code back (that I had used in the order that had been cancelled). Not good enough considering how much I was messed about by ASOS and how put out I was last min. I was now faced with the inconvenience of not having anything to give my Mum the next day because it wouldn’t get here in time - despite ordering 5 days in advance. And I now couldn’t get the items she wanted as they were out of stock. My 20% code back doesn’t really solve anything or leave me anywhere near satisfied. The CS staff member on twitter asked me to explain the situation. So I did and said ASOS customer service is a joke - to which ASOS replied, telling me to “Refrain from spamming”. Yet in the same breath, said they love feedback and always want to improve. I didn’t swear or say anything out of turn. Therefore, I didn’t appreciate passive aggressive comments. I work in customer service myself - and that’s unacceptable. Instead of saying “Don’t Panic” you’re trained to say “Keep Calm” - saying “Refrain from spamming” is a rude trigger phrase, inadvertently accusing me of spamming. Also, considering how unreliable and unprofessional ASOS have been creating this situation and how they handled it after - I have every reason to feel ASOS have let me down and I am firm but fair when explaining this. And yes - I will write a lot when the CS team on Twitter ask me to DM them explaining the situation. So don’t accuse me of “spamming”. ASOS should definitely train their Twitter CS staff on how to speak to people (because they aggravated the situation and made it 10x worse) and CS Online Help Chat team to offer reasonable solutions. Apparently the big problem solver was to give me back the 20% code that I had used in the order that got cancelled - TERRIBLE consolation, considering the issue was confirmed on ASOS end. Also a bit of a joke, considering how much I was inconvenienced by their problem, messed around, and spoken to by their (twitter CS) staff. Offering me my own discount code back was a total slap in the face and it made me think ASOS don’t take the issue seriously if they think that is satisfactory. Offering me my code back isn’t reasonable and doesn’t leave me satisfied at all - I would’ve thought that’s the LEAST they could do - but what good is giving me my discount code back when I won’t get the items I ordered (because they’re now out of stock) and I now won’t get anything in time for my mums birthday - despite having emails promising me they’d be here by now and the email confirming the order was definitely placed. ASOS are unprofessional and unreliable and I expected - at the very least - a notification telling me my order had been cancelled, and a WAY better solution for the inconvenience. I am still left SO unsatisfied!

            I have never really ordered clothes online and was extremely hesitant due to some terrible reviews i’ve seen of asos, but i decided to trust the good reviews and make a purchase. Because my order was over $120 (i spent $231) I was given free 2-day shipping (and I live in Texas) so I was skeptical that it would actually arrive on time, but I am more than happy that it arrived exactly when it said it would. I think that is so impressive. I bought 4 pairs of pants which all fit perfectly. The only thing I will say about them is that according to the “the model is 5”7 wearing a size 4” “84% of people with your body type purchased size 4 and didnt return it”, I’m almost positive it would not have fit had I gotten the recommended size. I only sized up because my recommended size was out of stock, but it ended up being the perfect choice and I’m shocked with how well everything looks on. I can’t say anything about the customer service because I didn’t have to return anything, but hopefully my next purchases will go just as smoothly as my first. All of the pieces felt good quality and not cheap at all. I’m very happy with asos and I felt that I should leave a review for anyone wondering if it’s worth their time and money. It is!!

            Wish I could give zero stars. I put in an order 3 weeks in advance for when I needed the items and was quoted the the arrival would be there within the week. About 2 and a half weeks later they were still in transit in New York and I wouldn't be able to get them by when I needed them, but don't worry they refunded my $3.00 delivery charge (gee thanks). Please don't order from this terrible website, they charge you for a terrible delivery service that isn't held accountable.

            When I need to buy any clothes online, asos.com is one of those websites I can trust. I really like that they have video preview option of the item (which allows to see how the cloth would look like on a real person), checkouts are really easy and you get free delivery on all orders over £20. However, about 50% of the clothes I bought via asos.com did not fit me (everything was ok with sizes, just the clothes looked differently on me than on those tall slim models), so I needed to return the items. Returns are free and easy as well, therefore I find this website as really reliable. The only I would wish would be greater selection of clothes as well as using ""regular"" sized person for videos instead of those models. Maybe the clothes would not look so nice, but at least your returns rate would decrease significantly.

            Last week I placed an order for a Dune Evania Black Cross body bag for a friends birthday. The bag arrived broken and faulty and in a completely unacceptable condition especially since the bag is £65!! I have since gone onto the website to place another order in good faith and realised the bag is now out of stock. My friends birthday is today and is completely ruined due to the lack of quality assurance at ASOS. I am very upset about this as I have been an ASOS customer for many years and this has left a very sour taste in my mouth. I have been on the online chat and the agent has simply told me to return the faulty product to receive a refund. I am sorry but this is not acceptable to me. I have also not been given a method to make a formal complaint.

            Good products and it's all good... until something goes wrong. The standard of their customer service is far below what you would expect from a retailer of their size. Here’s a recent example: - They delivered me the wrong item. - I contacted them to let them know, and asked if I could also buy the incorrect item they sent. They said no, and said I couldn’t buy/keep it (citing ‘stock issues’). They said I had to return the item before they would send the correct order.- I returned the incorrect item the next day via their courier. They emailed me again 2 days later asking me to return it(?), and told that the item I was “hoping for” (i.e. that I had already ordered and paid for) was no longer available. There was no apology. - I then checked and the item I’d already bought was still on sale on their website in my size. I asked for it to be sent to me given that it was in stock, and they said no as 'stock levels can change throughout the day for different reasons'. They offered no other help other than directing me to similar products on their site.- I am still waiting for a refund 2 months later.It’s stupid really – the result is that despite having spent hundreds of pounds over the years in ASOS, I am never going to shop with them again. Even just a proper apology would have gone a long way.

            Always been very satisfied with their speed of delivery and returns process. I also lost my returns label and managed to order a hermes delivery pick-up with no fuss which was very appreciated - not something normally available on online shopping.Also, just bought their own brand petit range products for the first time and very happy - neckline sits very well which is rare for me so overall very pleased. Very good quality.

            I was waiting for my delivery for over a week and then i receive an email saying, thanks for your return. It was a gift for someone and they ruined it. When i chatted with the customer care, they say there was a warehouse issue. They could have emailed me in the first two days, i would have bought it somewhere else. i haven't received the refund and they say it processing. ASOS used to be a good company, but now they don't care about their customers.

            My daughter bought 3 items, 1 of which she returned, in the end of november. She emailed, no answer. She chatted with different people and found out that the item was received by Asos and 'something went wrong with the payment of the refund'. After every contact she would hear from them within 4 days. Nothing. Problem is: they have no email adress (just a contact form but one can't prove sending a message). Three times chatting persons promised to send my daughter an email. Nothing. Changed email adress, nothing, changed it back, nothing. Just now I tried to contact the customer service again. They said I had to contact the Dutch customer service, so I did. Guess what: no chats, just a contact form! And UK won't help me anymore! My daughter sent another email but she doesn't expect anything anymore.So be ware if you want to order something form ASOS.com, you might never get a refund!UPDATE 10-17-2018: After 11 months my daughter finally received her refund. I contacted the European Consumer Center and they had to contact them 4 four times before the refund was finally paid. May daughter supposed to have received two emails from ASOS, but guess: none reached her (not in spam either). No excuse, no explanation, nothing. So the 1 star remained!

            I regularly use ASOS, it’s my online go to however, i don’t think it’s worth the hassle. What an experience dealing with there so called “customer service”. They are quite simply a joke and apparently incapable of reading. How many agents does it take to not resolve a issue, so far 6 and counting. My initial issue is that I returned items in a bag with a delivery note however, some how an item in that bag went missing and wasn’t refunded. Then it comes to light that is you use a promotional discount and return an item they deduct the entire discount. So my order £126 discounted to £106, returned £60 worth of items on which was faulty, receive £40 back. Now apparently this is clearly displayed in the t&c’s ( I’m pretty sure that using the term clearly displayed is inaccurate) but what I can’t understand can you not be entitled to a full refund faulty item? Some yourself the trouble, and spend you hard earnt cash, in one of the many other online retailers.

            Been a long time customer of the ASOS company. Recently purchased a Mango leather jacket, on the Outlet section, which originally costed 270 euro and with the sale it dropped to 121. Bought it and got in a couple days. Fitted nice and well and noticed the Mango label had a sticker on it, hiding the price. Peeled it off and lo and behold, the price ORIGINALLY was 180. Deliberately ASOS raised the price another 90 euros on top. Being a customer and business owner, I felt like I was cheated out of the so called ''outlet sale''. Contacted via email, Emma from support was very helpful and asked photos for proof. I supplied the photos along with the Mango label and the 180 price tag and she said she'd look into it and see how to work it out.After 2 hours, an Indian dude called Kajal replied, instead of Emma, with the typical ''by the books'' robotic reply along the lines of  ''the price increases due to varying costs'' and he didn't even bother offering a solution. Dissatisfied with his reply, I told him that even I'll take this matter publicly on Facebook and Twitter to raise awareness of the so called ASOS ''OUTLET SALE'' .Good job ASOS for the crap support.

            I should have read the reviews here before I decided to spend $150 on 3 pairs of shoes at ASOS and lose over $80 in import fees and return costs! I ordered in my size and none of the shoes fit - they're all 1 - 2 sizes too big for me. I was charged import fees already as I am in Canada and found out that they do NOT do free returns for Canadian orders. I spoke with a CSR on Live Chat and she was unsympathetic and unhelpful. She copied and pasted answers and redirected me to their FAQ - why would I go on Live Chat if my questions could be answered by FAQ? I expressed that I was disappointed with their customer service especially as a first time shopper and she responded with ""is there anything else I can help you with?"". DO NOT SHOP HERE, it is NOT worth your time or money.

            If I could give less than one star I would. They have no call center, probably because they do not have any customer service. They have promised me items ordered to come by March 8th and today is the 13th and they have still not arrived. I contacted them yesterday via chat and they said I should wait until 24th of March???? Over two weeks passed my expected delivery. I told them that I had plans for the clothes and have now missed the date and they’ve offered me no service to locate the items nor have they offered any compensation nor have they said they will remove the delivery charges. They have literally said nothing to me except that I should wait until the 24th of March. So horrible. They’ve lost me as a customer for sure. Worst mistake ordering from them, who knows if I’ll even get the items, maybe on the 24th they’ll tell me to wait until 2019.

I ordered a suit jacket and it arrived as though the DPD driver had kept it in his pocket. It was the only one in my size and so I wanted to keep it and asked asos to pay for it to be professionally steamed/pressed. Took three days of me nagging before they conceded.

When USPS updated their tracking it stated March 8th, which would have been ok since my event was the 10th. Low and behold March 8th came and went with no order. The order has still not arrived and its the 12th! Since it did not come in time for my event I had to make other arrangements for it, which is difficult since I am 8 months pregnant!

            I recently purchased a few items from your company. I was very excited to find your website, there were many items that I was indeed interested in. My issues started when I made my order and was told that I would receive my things the following Monday, I did not receive my things until the following Thursday. This however was not something I was that upset about. I was overjoyed when I did finally receive my package, but was let down when the items I had ordered in a size XXL fit more like a Large. Yet this is not what the cause of this letter. Today, as I am sitting at work the button on the side of my overalls, that I purchased from your website, has literally fallen off. This is the second time I am wearing this item. I am extremely unsatisfied with my order and as much as I love many of your items I unfortunately will not be purchasing from your company again and it is unlikely that I would recommend your company to my friends and family.

            If I could I'd give them a prize for the WORST customer support ever. I think that Siri would do the job better. To be honest, I don't think that's solely cs agents fault. They are put there to serve as punching bags without any real power to resolve the issues.

After you have already paid for everything, even if you pay extra for express shipping (i did in my case) they will hit you with an additional $50 charge and refuse to give you your order until you pay the extra money.

The replacement delivery they offered is the standard international delivery meaning which i have to wait for another 10days! i couldnt believe that i have to wait for a month for my parcel.

            ASOS is my favourite place to online shop. I rarely have complaints about ASOS. The clothes are generally good quality. The brands that are stocked are great and the plus size range, in particular, is ideal. You get a great mix of the basics and fancier items. Everything is fairly priced, the premier delivery service is perfect and I love how the majority of orders are sent with DPD.

They all tell you different things and I am now left having to wait 7 days for £150. (For a parcel I have never received.) They absolutely have no idea what they are doing.Warning: If your parcel is returned to sender, you have to wait 7 days for the warehouse to receive it, and then 3-5 days for the refund to process. Considering they can see you have never received the parcel to begin with, they should refund you as soon as the tracking shows they are going to receive it back. It is such a shame as I really like their clothing and online shopping is really convenient.

            Wish I had the option of giving zero stars. Bought a faux leather jacket in a large from the site; they accidentally sent me a small. No sweat, I thought, I’ll just return it and have them re-send me it in the correct size, or so I thought. They informed me that as I was receiving said small, the large option for the piece sold out, and was no longer available. Mildly peeved at this point since I was planning on wearing the jacket to my brother’s bachelor party, I nonetheless went along/was cool with them simply giving me a refund. I read their refund page around two days before the jacket was to arrive back at their warehouse/the refund was set to occur, which stipulated that ASOS does refunds through the card that was used for the purchase. I made the purchase through a Vanilla Visa gift card which was no longer in my possession/disposed of, seeing as its contents were rendered empty a month ago, and thus I told ASOS explicitly over chat NOT to send the funds back to that card account, as I would not be able to access it anymore. The person on the other line over chat agreed, and told me I would be contacted when they received the item back, and asked which account to properly send the money back to. Cut to the day of the refund... and they of course processed it to THAT GIFT CARD. UGHHH!!! I’m at a loss for words regarding this negligence/incompetence, so I reach back and demand to know how I could actually get my refund back. They say I need a receipt proving that I can’t access the funds, and Vanilla Visa says they can’t give me a bank statement without the full card information, which I no longer have because I NEVER THOUGHT I’D BE IN THIS MESS. The only thing I could do was drive two hours to the store I bought the gift card from and get a receipt/proof of purchase that way, just to show ASOS that it was indeed a gift card that they sent the money to. That apparently was not good enough for them, and they even refused to give me so much as mild compensation for my fool’s odyssey/any ASOS credit. F minus to the infinite degree for this site, lost two weeks worth of my paycheck in terms of funds, flushed down the drain somewhere in a gift card at the bottom of a Philadelphia garbage can. If anyone lives in the Center City area of Philly, good news: go dumpster diving, and you might luck out on ~$100 worth of free money. Actual trash company, ZERO OUT OF ONE BILLION.

            My information was compromised with ASOS. Do not save any information. For some odd reason my account was hacked and an attempted over $1000 charge of orders popped up. ASOS did absolutely NOTHING - they did not even notify me I had noticed this myself and went out of my way to contact them. The process took over a week to get someone on the phone to talk about the situation - completely unacceptable. All they did was delete my account. I avoid ASOS completely now - I'm not really missing much, the quality is terrible. It's the quality of Forever21 but with the pricing of ZARA.

            Their homepage is so deceptive. I’m from Canada and when I chose the Canadian region, they offer “free delivery and returns” according to the banner on the homepage. Turns out, delivery is only free if you spend over a certain amount and returns are $22.40. You will also have to pay for delivery fees twice if you return so that’s $30 x 2 = $60 + 22.40 = $82.40 which could buy another pair of shoes!! When I spoke to customer service (live chat) about the deceptive banner, they told me if I “hover over it” or read in their T&Cs I would have seen it. First of all, you cannot HOVER over a banner on a mobile phone and second, why put this offer on the page if you have to go to another page to find out you’re being lied to?! Deceptive company.

            I am not recommend you to buy nothing in this web!! Very bad quality!! Bad customer service!! I return them the package and it’s already 22 days and I didn’t got my money yet. I contact them 2 time in the first time they told me in 2-3 days i will see the money back. After a week that my money still not return to me I contact them again. And guess what? Still tell me to wait..!!

            My worst experience of online shopping! Ordered seven items and paid for fast delivery service. Only got two of the seven items (got the cheapest products). I already tried to send them a email and that chat on their website. No one can help me, and when they can’t answer my questions they just close the chat. So I paid 138£ for two pair of small plastic earrings. Worst service I ever had in my life!!!

            bought 1000USD worth clothes, few items were wrong size, 2 items of the order was completely missing.. contacted asos and they gave me a run around time saying they try to fix it and i should contacted them again and again.. 3 weeks in contact with them, they just disabled my account and no problems were resolved. Will never order anything again, people beaware, they are notorious for sending wrong items and not taking these back anymore.these negatice feedbacks dosent hurt their company, they are well established and marketed so they do not care about their clients.. anyone seeing this comment you should think twice before ordering from them.

            Wouldn't shop here again. Their return policy is weird , it would be simpler if you returned an item and asked for an exchange. For example, I ordered a size 6 and they sent a size 10. In order for me to re order another size 6, I would have to return mine, wait 12 days for them to get the order and then REORDER a size 6  . Seems simpler if I had sent back my size 10 with a request to send back a size 6, but noooo. Won't shop here again

            I ordered something, didn't get a confirmation email, got charged, and when I went to my My Orders list in my account, there was nothing.  I then went to customer service, which was the WORST customer care experience of my life (after telling me she couldn't find my account even though I sent her a picture taken right after showing my order was accepted, with my order number and everything, ALENA told me to ""please kindly leave the chat"" when all I did was ask when I  was going to get my order as it was a gift and I don't have time for the 1 month delays they usually put me through)  Overall, a complete rip off.  Please, no one buy from this site, not only does it have THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, they don't send their products almost everytime until you hunt them down and get delayed for a whole other month.

Poor and disgusting behaviour from such a big company will not be buying from them again.

            It seems every time I order from ASOS I can count on their being an issue. To make it even worse, ASOS has the worst customer service of any online store I've ever dealt with. Their answer every time is basically 'we can't help you' or 'sorry we messed up, you have to jump through loopholes to fix our mistakes.' Most of the clothes fall apart, my skirt broke before I ever got to wear it and my dress broke as I was in line for security art the airport.

            I have bought from ASOS over 100 times and had one 'incident' where a dress wasn't refunded however, turned out it actually hadn't been picked up from the click and collect shop therefore not actually the fault of ASOS. Delivery is next day for Premier customers (around £10 for a year's next day deliverable - unbelievable!) , the service is amazing and returns just as easy, and the one time the above 'incident' occurred, it was sorted super quickly via the help team.

            I ordered product for an upcoming trip. Order date Jan 15th, ASOS confirmed the order the next day saying it had essentially ""left the warehouse"" and the expected delivery date was Jan 30th 2018. ASOS also indicates after the fact that once your order is placed, a local post office will provide a tracking number, noting that they do not provide any details and it is up to the post office(s). It is now Feb 19th 2018 with no order, no tracking number, no confirmation of where my package is. I have spent hours on the phone with numerous post offices, which provides to be challenging considering they need some form of a tracking number in order to physically track any package. Not only did I pay for my order, I was charged $70 in customs fee's and it has been over a month. The only thing I've recieved from ASOS is a confirmed order email, and a month's worth of headaches.I have contacted customer service 3 times with SHOCKINGLY zero help. Each time the person on the chat/email says to wait another week and then they can look into my order. I've waited until today (as told), and contacted once again, for ASOS to then tell me to wait until tomorrow end of day.... seriously!? Delaying a mere 24hrs? This is absolute BS!!!!I will NEVER shop with ASOS again, the customer service is non-existent and they have no phone number as they pride themselves on being an ""online web-based community"". Save yourselves the hassle of having to find a needle in a haystack... needle being your order. For being such a large UK based company they are absolute crap in delivering product.. literally!!!

            terrible experience!  I ordered a gift for Valentines day on 9th Feb and my asos account said it was despatched on the 12th feb, it never arrived and then when I enquired they said there was a problem with the package leaving the warehouse.  I spent 25 minutes on the live chat trying to resolve it but didn't.  I asked for a refund and they said they had refunded me the cost of the item but they would let me know within 24 hours if I'd receive a refund for the delivery!  This is preposterous as the item never even left the warehouse apparently but they had taken the money out of my bank account the day I ordered the item.  Absolute rubbish! never again. I asked for a number for complaints dept but they said they wouldn't advertise the number as its all dealt with through email and chat.  I still haven't received my refund.  NOT HAPPY

And nothing ASOS could do to help me get my order by the next day in time for my engagement drinks. Very disappointing :(

            I have spent a fortune with Asos over the years and always been so happy with the service and ease with which you can purchase/return items. Recently however the service has been appalling and I’ve had to have several arguments over email and live chat to try and get resolutions, none of which I’ve been happy with! I’m taking a loooooong break from Asos. Hopefully they’ll get themselves sorted and back to a model which puts the customer first.

            Appalling customer services. The bigger this company has got the worse their customer service has become. I have been pretty brand loyal from when the company first came around, but now after multiple issues, and their huge lack of customer service I am done. They claimed to have dispatched my item, send a tracking, only to reveal this wasn't the case once I chased up my order and its whereabouts. So why was any dispatch emails sent if the item actually didnt leave your damn warehouse. And would they have even bothered telling me if I hadnt chased it up. Their customer service is the worst Ive encountered in recent years. Their twitter help stops responding to DM's, their online chat advisors end conversations without letting you respond. I wont be shopping here again. Ever.

            My experience with Asos started off sub-par, then escalated into HORRIBLE. I ordered from them a few months ago, and ended up having to contact them because my order was a week late. Ended up being 2 weeks late total. Same thing happened to my friend about two months prior.But the ""horrible"" part, was when my sister ordered a dress for use as a bridesmaid at my wedding, and the dress had not shown up after almost 2 months. When she finally contacted them, it turns out the dress was out of stock... so they TOOK HER MONEY, then DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER ABOUT THE ISSUE!! They tried to get her to have it sent in a different colour (won't work, needs to be pink), then proceeded to try and get her to reorder a dress! Absolutely not! Finally, a refund was issued in the end. However, neither of us will be using Asos again. Poor, poor, POOR customer service.

            No adequate complaints process.  Customer service assistants refuse to escalate issues and do not engage with problems.  ADR offered as next stage for which you have to agree to give a third party all of your personal data and permission to use it.  They also look quite likely to be less than independent.  Should be regulated.  Seems to be a trend with lots of organisations these days trying to provide the bare minimum customer service and fob off customers.

            Second time in 3 weeks my order hasn’t came. First time it apparently went “missing”. Second order was sent, delayed, and apparently sent back to Asos, and after speaking to them (who weren’t very nice and quite cheeky) I was told the order would not be resent back to me when it was sent back to them, and if I still wanted the items I was to reorder them. And that was it. I tried to do that and now the items are out of stock, when I know they are lost in DPD circulation somewhere! Terrible service, terrible attitude from staff.

            They do not ship to APO addresses PERIOD, do not even bother. I ordered two dresses for a military ball over a month ago. I talked to customer service via FB and they said they would send out two more dresses, one was out of stock so they said they would refund me, which they did. However, then I purchased a second dress to replace the out of stock one because I was hoping the shipping issues were resolved...guess what...NOTHING has shown up. Multiple orders, multiple FB conversations with ASOS, and absolutely nothing to show for it. I think it's terrible how they are ripping people off but also that they are falsely advertising that they ship to places they clearly do not. Either they need to change their carrier or stop advertising that they ship to APO's. Also, nothing from Amazon and Sephora or any other company I have used has not shown up, so I believe this is directly an issue with ASOS and their carriers.

            I paid for premium delivery to receive the item before 10pm the following day.  The item was delivered to an unknown location - the photo taken by the driver is not of my street.  There is no phone number, so I went through 'chat'.  I was told that ASOS had to contact the courier before they can respond.  That will take between 3-5 working days.  I explained that ASOS had entered in to a contract with me for which I had paid to deliver the item before 10pm tonight.  It was only around 3pm when I contacted them. ASOS need to honour their agreement with the client. I asked for my call to be escalated to a manager, so I could still receive my item.  This will take 24 hours.  I said I would contact consumer helpline.  They terminated the chat.

            Bought a dress for an event, and they sent the wrong one. I put in for a return/refund. Customer service says they will send me the dress again (after the event, so I don't need it). I say no, I asked for a refund. Cut to 3 different customer service people giving me different information about my refund. I finally send my return in and it gets delivered. 11 days after it arrives at the facility, no word. So I ask where my refund is. ""We haven't received the return yet"". Well actually, they sent me a tracking number that said it was delivered 11 days earlier!!!!!!! I tell them this and they FINALLY say they'll try and refund but if there are any issues they'll reach out. I hope that the refund clears, but I'm not feeling too confident. And I don't think they'll reach out with issues. I return has taken a month of ME reaching out to them! So insane, so many people saying different things.

            I waited all day for my parcel from ASOS.  I had paid a yearly special premium fee for items to be delivered the next day. It didn't arrive, even though I had received an email from them confirming it would arrive in the morning. The chat line was a waste of time. They don't seem to be able to help at all, just telling me it may take a week to arrive and just accept this.  Customer services refused to refund my delivery charge and to refund the dress I had ordered that was not delivered. I have been a good customer, this means nothing to them. I will never use them again. A very smug company with distorted customer care values. Avoid!!

            First time using this website, thought I'd try them due to student discount. They made me enter personal and student email. I then had to validate the student email and then it said they'd sent me a code to my personal email. After all this messing about no discount code came through, so tried clicking the verification link again and then got an email saying they'd already sent it??? contacted them on chat and instead of a simple apology and re-send they wanted photo proof of my student card, even though I explained I'd already verified my email. Had to take picture, email it to myself, download it and then attach to give it to them. They then wanted the back of the card even though I explained it was blank?? Sent it to them begrudgingly and was told they would get back to me in 24 hours!!!!!!!! Argggghh! so annoyed wanted these clothes for tomorrow, will go use my NUS card in the shops instead!!

            This company claims to offer 2 day shipping.  However, I have tried this twice and paid the extra $12 only to not receive the items later than promised.  To make matters worse, even when they claim they will refund the shipping, they do not.  In fact, they refuse to speak to me about the order since my daughters email address was used to place the order instead of mine.  My daughter is a minor, we used my credit card to place the order, etc.  Just beware when trying to get something from this co in a certain timeframe.

            Very very bad  customer service. I bought alot of products, and one was missing. When i decided to go and talk with them on chat, they were telling me that my order in not conected with the email i used on creating the asos account. I also proved with print screens that the order confirmation  was send on the specific email they said they can\t find. the bigger problem is that they are closing immediately the chat, therefore you are not able annymore to continue the discussion, so you have to take it all over again by starting a new chat and explaining 100 times same things. After 2 hours waisted my conclusion is, once you have something missing, you money are missing to. Good bye order good bye products

            I do not understand how a company like ASOS still uses DPD as their delivery agent. DPD is the worse delivery company. If you want something to be delivered to you and DPD does the delivery, it is likely that you will not get your parcel as per you delivery arrangements. This happened to me again today. I stayed at home the whole day and received a notification stating 'was unable to deliver, there was no one to sign'.. I am so disappointed with ASOS telling me that I need to sort it out myself.

            I ordered a pair of shoes over a month ago and received a black beanie hat instead- complete with a order label listing the shoes. Confused, I contacted customer support. They told me to send the hat back via my postal service in order to exchange it (for the product I originally ordered!). They also said I would receive a confirmation email when the hat arrived back at their warehouse. I waited for nearly two weeks with no email, so I finally got on the customer support chat to express my frustration and concern. The representative asked me if I wanted a refund or replacement, to which I replied the latter. They assured me they would have it shipped within 24 hours, and would send me a confirmation email. They kept their word this time, and I received an email with the product info. This has been a headache, and I will not be ordering from this company again.

Then they stated my items i ordered were out of stock anyway, and in order to get a refund i would have to return this 10.00 beret to get almost 100.00 worth of products refunded. In the US this is not required, and when i told them i would be notifying the bbb and opening a fraud report with my bank if they did not refund me for the items i didn't receive the rep responded ''no worries'' and ''go ahead''.

I was promised a refund to reflect on my account 19 January 2018 and the balance of shirts to be delivered 24 January 2018. I am still waiting. I was aiming to rock the shirts during my vacation, I am so disappointed. Asos is a NO!!!!!!!!!

            Ordered dress from Asos for daughter's debs in March.  Too small so returned via Post ExpressPost and ordered next size which was perfect.  No refund of 126 Euro received for returned dress, despite confirmation from Post that it was delivered on 22nd March 2017 and repeated requests for a refund.  Dealt with 7 or 8 so called customer service people and sent about 15 e mails but still no joy.  It was paid for online via Paypal.  Post cant help any further other than confirm return and give postal tracking number.  The numerous customer service people stopped replying to my e-mails.  I assume they hope I will just drop the matter.  I have approached the consumer protection agency and hope the issue can be resolved in my favour.  I would not advise anyone to deal with this company. I have wasted so much time trying to get my refund without any success.

            Used to buy on ASOS.com many times years ago. And this year, after a few years of pause, returned and made two orders already. What can I say? I read many recent negative reviews, but from my personal point of view - ASOS never let me down. I have made ~10+ orders in total: only positive experience. Keep it up!

            Regarding order 308016686,  we placed the order at 14/Jan/2018 and were expecting next day delivery however, we have not received the item till today. The DPD provided a photo to show that they have dropped the item somewhere in some other's rear porch (which we are not able to identify). We provided our rear porch photo and were told to wait two days first.And then, another two days... and then, were told to wait for 3-5 days so that DPD will investigate. Ten days passed, we were told that we still need to wait another 48 hours...We also got hung up twice rudely!!!!!  This is awful experience, we will NEVER buy items from them again.To us, the unpleasant experience is caused by ASOS although DPD may be blamed a little bit. It is ASOS's responsibility to fix it ASAP if items failed to deliver or to were delivered to an incorrect address.As a complaint, we have lodged the charge dispute.The ASOS customer supports that handle this case are:  Chloe and Clare.

            I have experienced such awful customer service from asos! After a month of chasing them because I still don’t have my goods, despite paying for next day delivery, they are refusing to offer me a refund because the DPD delivery driver says they handed it over to someone with my middle name at my address. I cannot stress how HORRENDOUS the customer service has been.

            I really like ASOS’s returns system. If you don’t like something it’s easy to post back for free and they always refund quickly. I like that they also use Klarna now so you can try before you buy. Delivery has been (mostly) quick and efficient. Never had any real trouble with them and they have a wide selection of clothing, shoes, accessories etc...would recommend.

            I’ve been using ASOS since I opened a bank account and have been paying yearly for next day delivery ever since. This company is my go-to for pretty much everything and so handy when buying last minute gifts! Asos have even started using Klarna (buy now pay later) which has saved me so many times from waiting for payday to come around. With next day delivery, fast refunds and awesome customer service you can’t go wrong! Asos = Gift from the heavens!Keep it up guys 👍🏼

            I’ll put the whole picture for you, Asos: Customer service = Useless Delivery Service = Hopeless I’m so appalled by how minimal the efforts the customer service provide us with the help. It’s almost like they copied and pasted from a manual book. My situation is, i ordered a wallet for my friend’s birthday and opted for free delivery because i spent $105SGD (01/16)i don’t feel like paying extra for express shipping  (cost $45SGD) since the birthday is on the 28th January anyway. Everyday i would check on the tracking website on the item’s whereabouts, but they stopped updating since the 18th. I contacted the costumer service she told me i should be expecting my order on the 23rd and to check the website regularly. This freaking morning (01/23) i woke up at my girlfriend’s house i checked my damn phone the status says they made a delivery yesterday (01/22) at 6AM so now my order is returned to sender. So i spoke to the customer service “Rory”, wasted my 30 minutes, only to uselessly told me to re-order and wait for my refund because there was nothing he could do.  So i kept calm saying “Reordering is basic. What i would like is a solution from a customer service. And technically it’s the courier fault for not updating the tracking site, should they updated out for delivery i would be ready since i’m always home”. But the reply was very dismissive he replied “I am simply stating your problem..” Lol. I know the problem why would you repeat the problem to me? so funny he admits that he can’t solve any problem. Then what’s the point of customer service? Anyway asked the refund duration, he tried to play with words saying 21 days and it takes 5-10 days to be back into your account. So i bluntly do the math on him “21 days + 5 to 10 days = 1 MONTH” and his response screamed negligence and ignorance he replied “yes that time frame”. In conclusion, i need to wait for 30 days to get my refund and reorder if i still am interested with the item and spend another $105. So if the next item has similar problem, i guess i get my money back in March. Since they probably thought i am as rich as Pablo Escobar anyway.. Ehh what’s another $105 until next next month? right? Wasted my 30 minutes. Asos has both terrible customer service + delivery service = Poop.

            Customer service is terrible when you have any sort of issue with an order. Someone purchased a gift voucher for my christmas and it didn't arrive. It took multiple attempts at chasing customer services to deliver my gift voucher to the correct email. They sent it to the wrong email 5 times and it took until mid january to get the voucher, only for me to go to use it and getting an error to say the voucher had been cancelled. Attempted to resolve this with an online adviser and was told to wait 48 hours for someone to respond. Still waiting to see if this will be resolved. More than anything you can just tell they don't care at all.

            Absolutely disgusted! Been an Asos customer since I was 16 (now 24) and I will NEVER order from them again. Was told my order was coming on the 17/01/18. It is now the 20/01/18 and using the Hermes tracker it tells me they have 5 failed delivery attempts. I have been home EVERY TIME they claimed they tried to deliver and no one came to my apartment. I have a concierge who is open until 8pm and during the times they claimed to have tried to deliver either myself or the concierge were open and NO ONE came. After speaking to the most useless live chat staff in history, I was given the link to live chat to Hermes. They were equally as useless. I emailed customer care and they said the same f***ing thing: ""I can see your parcel is being delivered today"". It ISN'T! I even made sure both Hermes and ASOS had my correct address and both confirmed the right one. So I know for a fact the driver just can't be bothered to come to my address. Customer service is an absolute joke. Asos is only good if you don't have a problem, otherwise they don't give a damn about their customers!

I emailed so many times and they rarely reply. You have to constantly send them emails asking for a response to the previous email sent. After 3 weeks they finally 'resolved' the issue by being informed it was delivered to the wrong address like I had said the whole time. They refunded my money and when I contacted them again saying 2 of the 3 items are now out of stock they told me to 'check back' every few days to see if the items are available again. Completely terrible customer service. Extremely unsatisfied. Been using asos for yrs but now I would never recommend them again.

            I have always used ASOS, was a fairly frequent customer. Paid for yearly next day shipping, never had an issue. Even with returns! Always completed and sorted.I received some A List vouchers for spending X ammount, brilliant, so then I go to use these vouchers and the code is marked invalid, it was still in date, still OK to use however it didn't work. I messaged the team via messenger, it took them some time to respond to this, then the asos member said they would have this looked into.... still no response, passed from member to member. Finally, the voucher is now out of date (after 2 weeks of being promised this would be resolved) then they no longer want to speak to me even though they said it would be resolved. They are really quite rude too. I email customer service, explain everything....yet receive an email apology and get told I will be contacted to resolve this. 3 Weeks later...NOTHING. Email again....get told the same thing...and a month on.. still no email from this 'team' who is looking to my problem.Time wasters.

            ASOS is honestly one of my favorite places to shop at. My orders come fairly fast, and if I have to return something it very easy to do and free which I love because I do a lot of online shopping and many stores do not offer that. That is another reason I keep coming back. The only thing I can say I do not like is that when an item goes out of stock, there is no way to track the item if/when it will become available again.

            A few weeks ago I would have been the first to sing the praises of ASOS. I’d never had an issue with them. However I recently made a purchase using an A list voucher and a gift card I got for Christmas. The order was unsuccessful, but they still took my gift cards. When I first raised this query, I was told they would be automatically refunded in 24-48 hours - annoying but fair enough if that’s the process. Four days went by and nothing. I tried to contact them via chat who were absolutely useless. I also messaged them on Facebook and they took over a day to respond any time I sent a message. By the time I finally got through to somebody who could help, I was told I would then have to wait for the gift cards to be refunded which then took another week. All this took nearly three weeks and the items I wanted were out of stock! Pretty poor for an issue that was their fault. Customer service was horrific and apart from to use my gift cards, I will not be using them again.

            Would give 0 if possible. Ordered a watch and received a grey t shirt- labelled as the watch with the correct barcode etc. I found it very difficult to find where to contact- no phone number just an online chat or email. They said the email service was taking a while so I did the chat. Spewed out generic and unhelpful responses and said they'd email me about it in 5 days. They then told me the watch was now out of stock but to get a refund I'd have to return the t shirt, which I was happy to do but I wanted my money back first. As it was immediately out of stock I felt this was purposeful because they had oversold an item, I feel like I have been deceived by them. I then had to go out of my way to return the incorrect item and haven't heard anything in a week. All I remember from the last time I did a return is it took a month- which is ridiculous anyway. But I shouldn't have had to do it in the first place. I'm truly upset by ASOS on this occasion and most definitely won't be using them again.

            This is hands down the most frustrating experience that I have had dealing with a customer service team. I made an order using my personal Mastercard, which shortly after I closed and started using a different account joined with my husband.  I contacted ASOS after making a return to let them know if the new card details.  I had to jump through minor hoops like showing that the first account was actually closed, which was expected.  We are now here over 1 month later and still no refund!! There is no way to get anyone on the phone and everytime an email is answered it is by a different person who obviously has no clue was they are talking about.  Someone claims to have called me but no missed call or voicemail - bit suspicious! They are fighting me tooth and nail, claiming that I have already received the refund and asking for more and more evidence when I have provided them copies of bank statements three times already.Best part is they have even addressed me as an incorrect name in an email! They called me the name of one of their colleagues, twice....so the care factor is obviously minimal and they are holding my money hostage. Don't even both ordering from here because you always end up making a return due to poor quality and as I've learned you aren't very likely to get your actual money back!

            They suck. No one answers the messages. I have a next day delivery with them which I paid for and also a confirmation from them that my package will arrive on the 17.01.18 between 07.00& 22.00 only to receive tracking info from Hermes that my package will infect arrive on the 18th apparently ASOS has changed their delivery service from UPS who delivered my packages promptly on time, religiously. Hermes charges 20c landline and up to 60c mobile to talk to and not helpful at all but of course they don’t mind keeping you online. ASOS won’t answer my emails, chat requests or messenger messages. Very unprofessional. It’s 03.15 and I’m still waiting for a response as I need to fly with the parcel tonight. I of course have had prior problems wich always need far too many hours communication before anything can be done if at all.

            First and last time ordering from this site. I ordered a jacket on the 27th of December and it was delivered to me a few days late - not a huge deal. However, upon opening the package, I quickly discovered that this jacket was SIGNIFICANTLY different than it appeared in the photos and description on the ASOS website. After waiting patiently and excitedly for this item to finally be delivered to me, I was very, very let down by the completely different item that I had received. Despicable way to run a clothing website. Be very cautious, and order at your own risk.

Ordered Saturday night, package one arrived yesterday (Monday) and other package came today (Tuesday) very quick! Packaging nice and easy to open, unlike some companies packaging. All items clean and packaged nicely. Have also returned stuff in the past from these guys, easy return process and got money back within the week....  what's not to like?! Will definitely be using them time and time again, pleased I found them!

            Ordered a 3 piece suit, paid for next day premium delivery. Got delivered a pair of white trainers instead.So I have contacted their customer support, and they apologised and said they will order redelivery for me, which will take up to 5 working days to be confirmed.I said ""wait a minute, I have paid for next day delivery"" and they replied ""yes, once the redelivery is confirmed within 5 days then we will post with next day delivery"" as if that was ok! Seriously?!So I went ahead to cancel my order and get the delivery cost refunded too. Now I have to run to the post office, post the parcel, once they get it they said it takes them 8 days to confirm the refund. It takes another 5 days for the refund to come through. So I am £230 out of pocket for 2 weeks because of their mistake!AVOID AT ALL COST!

            I ordered the wrong size by mistake but I have noticed it before the order was processed. I sent a message asking them to change the size since there is no price difference and the order was not even processes. They couldn’t due to security reasons thats what customer support said. They also said wait for the item to come and then return it and then you will get a refund and re order. I am from Cyprus and this is can take up to two weeks when they could just have changed the size! Frustrating!

            Their packaging is awful and they do not protect the items which ends up in them being damaged when you receive them. Then you have to go through a refund process which takes a month while they keep your money. It is unacceptable and honestly, the packaging is not that difficult. Protecting a nail vanish and NOT sending it in a plastic bag would be a good start, this company ruins clothes and items because they are too dense to package them correctly.

            I've been shopping there for years. I love the products and think they are great quality for the price. Beats H&M or Primark by a landslide. However, the customer service has always been terrible. I wouldn't recommend shopping with ASOS unless you must. As a plus sized girl, there's really nothing of similar price and style out there so I haven't got much choice but to kope with their bullcrap 9 out of 10 times I order. People aren't exaggerating. They need to rebuild their customer service from scratch.

            DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY. I ordered my item and was told I'd have it by Janaury 11. During that time, I received almost a dozen emails from UPS i-parcel that did not specify a location of my items. Needless to say, January 11 came and went. I chatted with a rep online on January 13 who literally said ""Sorry hiccups happen sometimes."" She told me that I'd have my item by January 18, so I asked when that date was ever communicated to me as a customer. She completely avoided the question and told me she advised all she could/would be closing the chat. I reached out to another rep about the company being deceitful and this rep now said I'd get my item by Janaury 22. It's funny how ASOS is quick to take your money, but is deceptive about delivery times/locations.

            Terrible customer service - they don't speak to the delivery service (hermes) on your behalf (against their policy apparently) however hermes advise on speaking to the retailer before them! It's basically a very annoying game of ping pong at the expense of the paying customer. With asos being such a big company, you would expect them to invest in a high standard of customer service. That is not the case and it's very disappointing when you spend ages trying to communicate an issue when you shouldn't have to.

            I've read a few reviews on here and on Facebook about poor customer service and I feel like I've had the complete opposite experience. A few things have been delayed or overdue but the customer care team themselves have been great!It did take them longer than normal to reply to my email over the Christmas period but this is advertised on their page as they are receiving high volumes of emails. I have returned a few parcels and they have not been refunded within the set 7 days, which is a little but of a pain but given the Christmas period I understand it may take a little longer. I have had 2 webchats with the team on 4/1 and then again today on 12/1 and each time they've been nothing but friendly and super helpful. They have asked for my proof of postage and tracking number, apologised that there has been a delay and sent confirmation of the return to be refunded to my bank. I get that it is frustrating when things go wrong, but as for the team themselves and the customer care they offer, they've always been fantastic and couldn't ask for more!!

            When I first started shopping at ASOS years and years ago, it was great! Clothes were beautiful, made well, fit well, but sadly that is all now a thing of the past because their quality has declined so much over the years. I knew it was time to stop shopping with them when FOUR of my orders in a row had to be returned either because they were ill fitting, bad quality, or not at all like they were shown as on the website. They've become laughable now and have gone from a reputable site for fashion to literally a Forever 21 knock off. Plus, everything seems to go out of stock extremely quickly and they never restock anything.

Also we do not care for our customers is our motto.""Contact us after two days and we will try to sort it out"" Customer service also not very helpful, worst customer services I have ever seen.I think asos management have to change. This is  frequently happening. You guys have to sort yourselves out. Change your delivery companies. At least asos could compensate or give a discount code for their customers. Managers need do a proper course in managing employees and with  proper training this would never had happened.Take some training skills and management courses from Amazon. Never had issues with them and if item was not delivered next day than I was always given a discount voucher for next delivery.

            Absolutely shocking experience with ASOS. First and last time I will be using the website. I ordered a skirt for an event well in advance (roughly 3 weeks) to give myself enough time incase it didn't fit to find something else to wear. Firstly my package was 4 days late to deliver taking nearly 2 weeks to arrive. I was so excited to receive my package but to my disappointment I received a pair of pyjamas NOT A SKIRT. I immediately emailed ASOS customer care team on the 19th of December and kindly explained the issue. After getting no response I sent the package back 2 days later and requested a refund. I didn't receive an email back until the 9th of January so it took them 3 weeks to respond to an email. I'm am absolutely shocked by the appalling customer service for such a well known website. I am still awaiting a refund which will probably never happen. Shocking experience....do not use this website!!

            Ordered some Replay jeans in the sale, waited almost a week for them to arrive & when I opened the package it was a totally different pair of (awful) jeans. Contacted the ASOS customer service via their online chat as they don't take phone calls & was told my only options were to wait to see if they get the correct jeans back in stock or send it back & wait for another 2 weeks or more to get a refund after I send the incorrect one's back... by which time I won't be able to get anything in the sale elsewhere. This is the second time this has happened to me with ASOS despite the fact I have only ordered from them a few times. The last time this happened was a couple of years back & I thought I would give them a chance again given the time that has passed, but it seems that they will still just shove anything in a bag & send it to you if their warehouse don't find the item you have actually ordered. It seems it is too much trouble for them to contact you to say they can't supply your order & give you an option of a refund at that time

            Clothing did not fit like it was portrayed. I ordered 2 separate orders back to back and one showed up a week later than the other. I’m not even going to attempt to send the items back. Well it looks like I have some motivation to lose some pounds this 2018! Since this jacket is bomb AF and it was $300! Get your act right ASOS! Lol

            Fantastic service as always. I have ordered from ASOS for years and always been very happy. Great website, very easy to use, make purchases and check out. Super fast delivery and a great deal with their subscription which includes free next day delivery for a year. Only one point on an issue with the site is that items drop out of your basket after an hour. A few times I have spent a couple of hours shopping online, looking through thousands of items, comparing them, checking sizes etc, by the time I'm ready to check out half the basket is missing as I can't remember what I've lost. I have given up a few times when I'd been about to spend several hundred pounds.

            Was told delivery date of product would be on or before Dec 20. January 6, still didn't arrive. Talked to a customer service rep. She said it got ""lost"" and would send another right away, express delivery. Ok, all good. Then got told it wouldn't arrive until January 27. I checked on their webiste and saw express should arrive by January 11, so I called to ask. This is the time I got upset. They said if it is express delivery, I would have to pay customs fees. Why did that not come up the first time? Then, they said that I had to go through their ""checks"" to verify that I did not recieve the product. Why would I have to do that when I was told it got lost? Nope, their answer was - I had to go through these checks before the order gets processed. It is like they did not want to re-send even though they had already confirmed that it got lost. I will never buy from them again.

            First of all the service is hideous!! I was supposed to get my package in what they call express delivery and was extra charged for that by the local customs, but it's been more than two weeks and I'm still waiting for it. Asked the support to refund me for the ""express delivery"" charges (15 pounds should be peanuts for them..), but it's like talking to a wall.The support agents barely know English and the answers they provide are totally out of context.Beware of this seller and watch the delivery method you are offered (I have applied a discount code and the delivery method changed to express so it could be a scam and not a real discount). Real disappointment, would expect more dedication from such a big company.

            I would rate ASOS zero stars if I could. I ordered some trainers that were on sale on the 25th December. I received my order on the 3rd January as stated. However, on receiving my order I found that they had sent me the wrong trainers. The trainer box was for the pair that I ordered but there was a different pair in the box.I contacted ASOS who made no effort to supply me with the product that I had ordered. Their response was that the item was out of stock and that they could not order more stock in. They are processing a refund for me but due to their incompetence I have missed out on a good deal and I am out of pocket ordering the same trainers from another website. I will not be ordering from them again! Becareful that you get the product that you paid for!!!

            I ordered a shirt and cardigan from ASOS, I received an email to let me know that the order had been despatched, then the next thing I know I'm receiving an email to say the courier missed me as I wasn't in. However there were 4 people in on the day they claim to have attempted delivery, including someone in the front room right next to the door! Further evidence that they didn't even attempt to deliver my parcel, no calling card was left to say they had been and missed us. Instead of ""reattempting"" they returned my parcel to ASOS. Now ASOS will not offer me anything despite the fact no one tried to deliver my order, and now one of the items in my order is out of stock. So I am left without my order for absolutely no reason. DO NOT TRUST THIS RETAILER!

            My wife ordered a pair of boots for my Christmas present. She got the order confirmation emails and dispatch confirmation notification with a tracking number. It was getting close to Christmas but we were within the pre Christmas delivery deadline.To make things easier, I suggested that she use Collect Plus. That way we could collect the parcel at our convenience instead of having to wait in for it.She never received a notification about the item being delivered to the Collect Plus collection point so she called ASOS. They assured her that the item had been despatched and put her on to Collect Plus but they claimed that the parcel had never entered their system. This would explain why there was no tracking updates although ASOS later claimed that the parcel had been sent using a non-trackable service?On Dec 27th my wife received an email telling her that her returned item had been received by ASOS.Another call to ASOS customer services and a conversation with some hapless mug who was only authorised to say ""I'm really sorry"".He did offer a 10% off voucher (I get an email practically every morning offering me 10%off).In short, I feel royally screwed over by ASOS and if I saw their CEO crossing the street, I wouldn't even brake.

            They deactivated my account for returning items for no reason. I returned my orders roughly 5 times in a 2 year period because it didn’t fit and I didn’t like it. So it’s against their policy to return clothes now because you’ll be banned?  I messaged them and they’re telling me it’s because “I made a much higher than average number of returns”. It’s not my fault the clothings are trash. No wonder why their sales have taken an 87% plunge. Hopefully they’ll go into administration and Asos will no longer exist soon.Will shop elsewhere.

They resonantly updated there website which is really easy to use. I'm a premier member so everything I order arrives next day by DPD, which is great because I can live track where my parcel is.

For starters they don't stretch at all.  I couldn't even get my foot in.  The inside was all coming loose.  I waited a week and a half for them to be delivered.  I won't shop here again or recommend asos to anyone.  I also did not recieve any notifications during the process of my order.  Nothing to say it was placed successfully or to say when it would be delivered.   There was an advertisement on the website which stated that if the order was made by a certain date then it woukd arrive before the new year.  This obviously did not happen.  I did get a text message to say that my parcel was with the delivery driver.  10 minutes after it had been delivered.I expected more asos.

            I've used ASOS for just over a year now and have made 5+ orders,  most have been perfect and a return made that was refunded as soon as they received it. However recently i placed a hefty priced order £100+ and i qualified for free next day delivery, here we are 4 days later and all the ASOS chat team can do is give me excuses. In my most recent chat i found out that my order has been lost, so now i have to wait ANOTHER 4 days to receive an email about replacement order, which will take another 3-5 days to be delivered. I think this is a joke, and the 'help' team provide no help but only make excuses.Update... i got the email about a replacement order, and because they lost my first order, 2 of the items (the ones i wanted the most) are now out of stock so cannot be resent in my replacement order.

            Placed order with ASOS with a promised delivery date, no parcel arrived so contacted chat, just gave a load of excuses and email links - then closed ended chat when could no longer explain why they had taken money and not delivered - not a very honest company !

            Once again ASOS have failed to deliver on what I’ve paid for. I have the premier next day delivery Service but again I’ve been told that there’s a delay on my order.They’ve failed to deliver on what I’ve paid for so should get a refund but they’ve refused.I’ve been a customer for nearly 15 years, but not any longer.  They used to be good and always my go to company, but the service has been rubbish for the past 2 years.  There are so many other, better online companies to choose from nowadays, so that’s what i’ll be doing.

            I have been purchasing from ASOS for years now. I always liked their selection of products and they (used) to have pretty decent quality. But the last few times I have ordered (why I keep ordering I dont know..) have been bad experiences. Firstly, as a Canadian customer it's just not worth it to buy from them. You have to pay for returns which are extremely expensive so it better be worth it. Furthermore, if you order items over 80$ you usually get nabbed for duty and it's BAD. But more than that each time I have ordered in the last 6 months I have not gotten my order for almost a month. The site will tell me the date by which I should definitely recieve my items by and they just dont come until well after. Currently, I am waiting on an item that I had ordered to come by Christmas (and the site told me it would) and it still isnt here a week later (its been over a month now). I contacted customer service and they are no help at all. Each time I have contacted them in the past about missing parcels they just keep giving me another week to wait and offer no recourse. The other thing I dont agree with is that they do not give Canadian customers tracking numbers. This means they/you have no idea where they parcel is. The CS rep told me to call around to various post offices so I'm basically on a wild goose chase for my item. Further than this I have experienced many site glitches where I order an item, order goes through, then I recieve an email a day later saying the item is out of stock. Another time their site glitched and an order went through 2x and I couldnt cancel the order within the hour time frame because the site was down. They told me I'd have to wait for the item to arrive then return it... major hassel for me and that means I have to wait until the item arrived, pay for shipping back, then wait another 1-2 weeks for the item to get there and them to process the refund.  After many purchases I will not be buying from them again.

            I've never had a problem with any of ASOS's services. I order almost weekly from there and my stuff is always delivered on time and promptly with DPD.Once or twice I've had a couple of issues with item quality - I received a pair of boots with frayed laces which snapped as soon as I tried the boots on so reached out to their customer care team. It took a day for them to reply (understandable during their busiest time of the year) but a replacement was arranged very quickly which arrived promptly too. They have a pretty good loyalty scheme too.I've only ever had one order late, by just one day due to a DPD mis-sort and everything else has always arrived on time. Returns are quick to process and never had any issues. Thanks ASOS!

Instead when i checked the tracking it said "" Posted through Letter Box "" Unless you have a cat flap on your front door there is no way a shoe box let alone 2  could possibly fit through a traditional letterbox. I contacted ASOS customer support who said they may send replacements if nothing has arrived by the 03/01/2018 - the tracking says "" posted trhough letter box""? Obviousley they will not come.  I even checked with my whole street but no sign. Terrible First experience and i can honestly say i WILL NEVER USE THIS SITE AGAIN, unfortunately i still have another item on it's way ( apparently ) Do yourself a favour and read the reviews and shop elswhere.

            Usually I do some shopping in ASOS online website. The clothes that come are generally really good. But this last time, I ordered a Jumpsuit and it was absolutely different from the picture and didnt fitted well! So, 6th of November I returned it back with Aramex Courier. From the info I got from asos I will get my refund only after ONE MONTH!!!(WTH&&&!!!???) But okay, so I decided to wait. I went for vacation for a month, and when I came back on 23th!!!! of DECEMBER (LOL) and verified my paypal balance. Of course no money was refund to me.So I contacted the asos customer service, and they informed me the package hasnt been received and they will verify again and that will take more 15-20 days. SO ASOS!!! WTH IS THIS? When it comes to take the customer money it is detucted right away, but if the customer is not satisfied with the LOW QUALITY items he receives.... then you really dont care to give a refund and you try to delay it as much as you can. what kind of policy is this? After this experience.. I dont think so I will order from ASOS ever again.

            I live in Singapore. I input an incorrect shipping address for my order. This is my fault for not thoroughly checking through whether ASOS was able to deliver to POPStation (a self-collection method).I immediately contacted ASOS customer care one day after asking if I can change the address. The customer care assistant told me after delivery fails I can change my address. I was relieved.I tracked my parcel daily eagerly awaiting it. On the 4th day past estimated delivery date, my parcel status suddenly changed from ""In Delivery"" to ""Return to Sender"". I was alarmed and immediately contacted ASOS. They told me delivery to my address failed and thus, a full refund was to be processed. I was puzzled. I did not receive any email or message for a re-delivery and certainly did not want to refund my items. They did not tell me anything, just sending my parcel back without even informing me. On the ASOS website, it even showed my parcel is still in deliveryThe customer care told me to re-order. Items would take 21 days to return to their warehouse and a further 5-10 days for the money to be refunded. What's worse was that I ordered during a sale and re-ordering would lose that huge savings I would get. Even worse was that one item was the last in size and the customer care could not even guarantee me reserving that size.Overall, immensely disappointed with ASOS. They have a huge catalogue and good prices. However, international delivery is full of problems and customer care do not have much power to help you. Compared with Lazada whereby the customer care could easily coordinate with courier, ASOS really needs to work on its service. I may buy again because their catalogue is really huge but not after checking out other sites first.

            Ordered a £60 pair of earrings for a Christmas present, paid £7 for next day delivery in the evening between 6-10pm. Gets to 8pm and I decide to track my package and am horrified to see that it states my package was successfully delivered and signed for! Contact Asos straight away as I have not received my package or signed for it at all and tomorrow is Christmas Eve. Speak to Anthony the chat advisor who is the nastiest piece of work, jobs worth I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to and clearly has no empathy or business working in customer service. All I received was copied and pasted useless info and was blatantly ignored. Now I am not getting through to anyone and am £60 out of pocket and without my present, Christmas is ruined and Asos are not interested in helping me. Anthonys bright idea was returning the earrings for a refund which is genius considering my issue is that the earrings haven't actually turned up in the first place but I will be happy to send Anthony a pair of non existent, imaginary, invisible earrings in the post and hopefully they will actually reach him! don't order from Asos.

            Ordered by the cut-off for pre Christmas delivery, my sons Christmas present.  Tracked the order and find out it arrived in Brisbane yesterday at 10am (I live 1 hour away on the Gold Coast).  Spent 2 hours in online chat and on hold to Toll (domestic courier provider) only to be told it will not be delivered until 28th December (was ""estimated"" for delivery 22nd December).  I have finally been informed their ""global delivery team is on holidays until 27th"".  So great, I don't get my parcel until next week and therefore my son will be waking up on Christmas morning with no presents.  I could have spent the money elsewhere but can't afford anything else now.  Requested refund so I can go and buy something else but told no because the parcel isn't ""lost"".

            Awful! Be very careful when choosing express shipping as they tend to forget to warn you about extra duties and taxes that may come with the delivery. A $75 dollar sweater became $150 after all taxes and $15 express shipping. It's probably $5 value item. Customer service ASOS is just beyond the worst ever! 1. there is no person to talk to but you can use messenger (Are you for real?) 2. their answers are just mean, unpersonalized and somewhat rude. 3. they thank themselves for resolving the problem in the very first reply!!!

            I placed my first order with asos, for 4 jumpers on 14/12When my parcel arrived, once of the jumpers was the wrong size. I checked my delivery note to see if I had made a mistake, the delivery note was correct but asos had sent me the wrong size.No telephone number to call, so had to use facebook messenger. I received a reply the next day to apologise and advise gthe correct item had been dispatched.I received the second parcel today, lo and behold it is incorrect again. Despite clearly stating the item title and product code, asos sent me the wrong item this time.Once again I used the frustrating customer service online system, this time with live chat. I understand that asos will be busy at this time of year, but the response I receive was truly dreadful.Frankie said that it would be 48 hours before this could be 'looked into', which quicky changed to 72 hours. when I asked why this was different to the advice received on messenger, I received no reply. I was told that this would not even be looked at until after xmas. I asked for the complaints process details, Frankie became very awkward and that the online chat was the complaints process (not true) and she would ask her supervisor to call me in 48 hours. This sounds very strange, untrue and completely unhelpful.I googled Resolva and instantly obtained their postal address and telephone number! FYI this is 02077561000. Called and got through to a friendly chap, who ultimately couldn't help me. Asked me to go online, but the correct item again (it is in stock) and return the incorrect items. He did promise to refund my next day delivery charge by 'keepinig an eye on my accout' for the next hour. Trusting his promise, I did what was agreed. No refund of the delivery charge eve came through. I also have no clue if I will get the correct item - on my third attempt.All contacts at asos were made aware this is my first ever order and that these are needed for xmas. This made no difference to their apathy. My first and last ever purchase due to the truly horrific customer service.

            If I am honest about this company.. the experience I have had was pretty poor. Now I ordered a pair of boots from the ""me to you"" service to Asda so I could click and collect - this is the worst experience I have ever had.. if i could explain it would take me a long time but please do not use this service as it is terrible. Also I have worn these boots which are over the knee which I was excited to wear. These appear perfect on a model but when I wore them with a pair of thick tights.. Well on my way out they were falling down past my knee.. wasn't happy as you could imagine as I have pretty decent legs and I had to keep pulling them up past my knee which was embarrassing. For £35 I would of got a better pair from my local Wynsors and for alot less hassle. Good luck shopping with ASOS as you will need all the luck in the world with this site!!

            So I found a gift for my boyfriend, I’ve been deciding on sizes for over two hours and the website was very helpful at finding the right size, they have very helpful tips for it. However, than I’ve read reviews and got super nervous. I decided to chat with customer service rep and I was connected immediately. Stephanie (I believe that was her name, not quite sure) was very fast and helpful, she checked for me if the items were in stock and I decided to take my shot with this company. I got free 2-day shipping for spending over $140. The order was placed Saturday night and than Tuesday I received my package. The box was a little damaged (but that is exactly what the box is made for, so no complains about that as long as items are ok) thankfully items were not touched. I am very happy with my purchase, I will be a returning customer now for sure

            I ordered from ASOS for the first time this week, and I am extremely happy with my experience. From the start, the website is easy to navigate and extremely user-friendly. There were many options when creating my account (very accommodating!) and purchasing was very easy. They offer student discounts and free shipping also. The free shipping is a MUST for a low-budget online shopper like myself, and not only was the shipping free, but it was extremely quick, arriving 3 days after I placed my order. I am also pleased with my return options- I received a shipping label in my order with easy-to-follow instructions on returning. I will definitely shop on ASOS again.

            ASOS you’ve lost yet another customer as I will never purchase from you again. Bought a coat for my daughter in a size 12 for £75 but it was too big so I returned it and ordered it in a size 10. The size 10 was discounted and cost me £60. Despite returning the size 12 which was at full cost, ASOS saw fit to only refund me the discounted amount. Totally unlawful. Emails promise somebody will contact me but it never happens. Vote with your feet folks and then gloat when this sh1t company goes under.

            I use to be a loyal customer of Asos for many years. They are great, until you have a problem. They have absolutely awful customer service. I ordered presents from the site for Christmas, it's been nearly two weeks after they were meant to be delivered and I still have received nothing. Contacted their customer team on chat five times. Not one person was helpful or even polite. Shocking service. There clothes are good but there service is terrible! Avoid at all costs. Told a Asos member on chat that I wanted to complain and she said there isn't a number to complain. She said someone will ring me.. but I doubt it.

            This website give you great deals and lure you in with free delivery, but their delivery service is absolutely crap! They don't update you properly on the status of your order. I signed up with Facebook which is registered to my old email address and I changed it on the account but the notifications were still sent to my old email address as a result of this my parcel was returned and I now have to wait for a refund. They texted me to tell me my parcel had been returned but they didn't have the decency to text me when it arrived at 6:45 the next day as I ordered on a Saturday, this was a Monday for delivery, and by the Tuesday they had sent it back. When I checked the website it said the estimated delivery was Wednesday! When I tried to contact them to seek help to resolve there was no one to speak to and the chat advisers were rude and unhelpful. Really poor customer and delivery service. Save yourself the trouble and go out to the shops. They will only waste your time and make you wait for a refund.

            Asos use Hermes as a courier and because of this, parcels are often not delivered within the specified timeframe. When you try to contact them, their messaging service does not work, and they are slow to reply to emails. Their poor rating is justified.

            I am here not to rate their products, but their customer service. I am really disappointed with the customer service. It is the first time I needed help. I sent an order to the wrong address, realised later than an hour and no one could help me, even though the courier said that if Asos sends the correct address, it will be sorted. They kept on repeating the same thing. That they can't change the address, even though the first time I contacted them was before the order has been processed. And then I contacted Hermes. Hermes said that if Asos tell them the new address, they can change it, as they were the ones that placed the order. Fair enough. But Asos simply didn't want to help. They kept on trying to convince me that first it has to go to that wrong address, and then they might change it. But that was what I was trying to prevent as we recently moved and there are new tenants living there. That was the whole point of the ping pong between Asos and Hermes, two of the most rigid companies I ever came across. No one wanted to meet me half way. It turned out that I made the same mistake on Amazon, but they just didn't give up until they solved my problem. Excellent service.Update: The parcel was delivered to my old address, I went there but no one answered even though I announced my visit by post and after contacting ASOS again, I received a refund. This made the matter a bit better, but I still had to go buy a different Christmas present. So a lot of time and energy wasted for nothing.

            I ordered three dresses from ASOS and all of them have a weird fit. It is not always clear what fabric they are made of and the sizing is waaaaay off. Two of my dresses look absolutely nothing like the pictures in real life. One of them even has a different color and length. The materials are mostly cheap but the dresses are quite expensive (for what you get), so all in all, too much of a risk for that price. I've had to fix all three dresses, making it even more expensive. Their delivery was also late.

The only time I have an issue was with my item not being received even though when I tracked it  said they had it. I spoke to customer service on Live chat, sent them a pic of my receipt and they processed a refund for me.

            Two months ago I got married, and for my big day I have ordered two shoes, a pair of ballet flat, and high heels both for to wear at the after party. In the meantime there was a burglary issue going on in our apartment, people was stealing others left packages in the entrance of the building by the couriers. My order has arrived two days before the wedding, I got the message to my phone, was out but never thought that the burglary can happen to me. I couldn’t find the package when I got back to home, knocked the doors of the neighbours, posted to the FB page of the building, no one has seen it. It was the middle of the night, and you can imagine how I was exhausted from all these wedding stuff, and things get went wrong. I reached the ASOS customer service, explained them the situation, and told them they were for my wedding a day after tomorrow. After a half an hour conversation, they told me they will send the order again, which I couldn’t believe. But the next day, at 7 or 8 am, they were really there! They perfectly fit and are smart. Now, I know what you think, that doesn’t sound a big thing maybe, but for a bride-to-be who dealt with bunch of problems, and customer services for 3 months, that was the fastest and easily solved problem. I mean they arrived only 7 hours after I reached them about the issue. So, really, they got the award for the best customer service in my own opinion. Thank you to the person I spoke from the bottom of my heart.

            ASOS has some pretty nice things in good prices BUT being an e-shop means that they actually have to get them delivered to you as well. This would be a piece of cake if they co-operated with any decent, professional delivery company, instead of a bunch of lads. I ordered from Asos first time two years ago. My order was never delivered but the so-called delivery guy marked it as successfully delivered (either binned it somewhere or decided to keep the skirt for himself). I had to call the company and make a written complaint and I got my order a few days later. After that I wasn't very keen on ordering again but two years later, I convinced myself to try them again. This time I ordered a nice Superdry hoodie for my husband's birthday. The hoodie was supposed to come on or before his birthday and guess what. After I spent allllllll day at home waiting (since I kept receiving texts saying that they are coming in an hour or two) at around 8 o'clock in the evening I finally came to terms with the idea that I was once again played for a fool. I was left with such a dissapointment, a ruined birthday surprise and fifty something pounds less in my bank account. I am NEVER ordering from them again

            Having used ASOS for many years and now and being a Prime member, I am very disappointed at how little  ASOS care when thye Fu@k up! I ordered something yesterday for next day delivery - part of a birthday gift which I need for tomorrow. The item arrived today - completely smashed to bits, because some idiot thought it was appropriate to package GLASS tealight holders in a bit of bubble wrap and then put in the usual ASOS plastic bag. I contacted ASOS and basically they couldn't care less about the fact this is entirely THEIR error (i.e not an issue with the product itself being faulty but rather they have not packaged it appropriately, hence it arriving broken) they offered a refund OR a replacement and seemed to think they were doing me a huge favour by not requiring me to return the item! Why would I return something that smashed to bits??. Basically they have offered nothing by way of apology for the inconvenience their stupidity has caused. I tried to reiterate this several times but was simply told they don't offer compensation. All I asked was that they re-send the item(which by the way cost a measly £7 so no skin off their nose!) AND refund me by way of an apology. But this was too much for them it seems. For the sake of £7 they have disappointed and annoyed a loyal customer.

            I'm very upset with my most recent purchase from ASOS. I bought a dress 6 size up because I had no expectation of it fitting someone who wear a size two. Dress comes a week and a half later and it doesn't fit I can't even put my head through it. Reorder two MORE size up so a 10 because hey it should fit right AND there's no other size offered. Dress gets lost in delivery it finally comes the day before I need it and it's too big another week and a half later. Sizing is  not accurate AT ALL I'M very disappointed in the products. Also to top it off my shoes don't fit at all both same size yet one too big and one too small. What's the point of a size chart when no one follow the measurements. Waste of time I will be sticking to traveling distance stores I just need my money back thank you very much.

Shipping notification on November 11, December 14 still no package. Contacted ASOS on December 6 about missing package, told me shows it was out for delivery Nov 30 and I should ask neighbours and contact the post office, non option the package is gone. Under UK rules they need to deliver within 30 days or the agreed upon date  (November 28) but they dont care about business regulations, over a dozen emails refusing to do anything until December 16.

            I am sadden that I have to give this company 1 star I wouldn't have given any!I have been trying to chase my parcel now for three days and no one is helpful at all... customer care service, they don't care. don't email you back or give courtesy calls.Tried explaining to me that they have no contact details for the couriers they use!! Really??? I work for an online retail company who are excellent may I say, so I know that this is not true we have contact details for all our couriers.I was due my parcel Monday no one called to say it wasn't being delivered and I had a new timeslot so I missed Tuesday's, soooo I have no idea when I'm getting this!! Would not recommend this company to anyone!! Thanks ASOS! for nothing...

            Ordered Saturday for Next Day, email confirmed Sunday delivery, new email stating Monday - delayed by one day, ok not ideal when you’ve paid for Next Day, Monday text arrives parcel is with UK Mail for evening delivery, come 10pm still no delivery, Tuesday and Wednesday also pass, Thursday tomorrow, no new notification - email customer services several times, no answer, no replies - shocking service. Will never use again. Ordered from House of Frazer on thre same day, which arrived without issue...! Be aware read the reviews...!!! Shop elsewhere.

            NEVER BUY VOUCHERS FROM ASOS!Purchased online vouchers but they have never arrived, they refused to refund or apologise so I am £50 out of pocket. They admit fault saying that the error happened “due to an unfortunate IT processing error which was out of their control” but they have no mechanism in place to refund as I purchased using Paypal, so essentially theft.

            I ordered a pair of shoes using next day delivery for a party. When they had not arrived two days later i contacted asos and they responded saying there had been trouble with them leaving the warehouse and i would not be receiving the items. Really bad customer service there was no apology and i was told the refund can take up to 14 days although the status on my delivery still says out for delivery and i am getting fobbed off by automated messages from asos. I always shop with asos and as a loyal customer this is really disappointing. The worrying thing is although someone on there web chat said i would be getting a refund this was not confirmed with any email or any status change on my orders on my asos dashboard. such a shame

            Absolutely terrible customer service, if you can argue it even exists. I requested for my order of value ~£200 to be left in a safe place in my rear garden by courier company DPD. I received a text message only, no note through the letter box, to let me know it was left there. It was no where to be seen when I arrived home later that day. DPD failed to take a photograph to support their claim that they left it my garden. This information took me 1 month and 1 week to receive after going back and forth several times with ASOS Customer Services, who repeatedly would let me know that they would get back to me within 48 hours/1 week etc - all time frames they set themselves, and of course failed to comply with, making this situation even more disappointing. Furthermore, getting my name wrong in their emails too, which is further evidence of their sloppy and careless customer service that I was provided with. It wasn't until I was on hold for over 20 minutes that I was given the information that I had been chasing via email, and only to be told that there is nothing they can do. Beyond disappointed and shocked at the low level of customer service provided by a company of their magnitude.

            Absolutely rubbish - as a long standing customer, I've used Asos for many years. I won't be using them again. I feel so strongly I've even emailed the top man, the CEO Mr Beighton, and told him his company is going downhill. I paid for next day delivery, didn't happen. When the delivery man did come,he delivered my parcel to some random address. I'd even got up from my sick bed and waited around for the two hour window I was given, but my order still went elsewhere. This wasn't the first problem with delivery, and, as many have said, customer services is shockingly poor too. Their responses are impersonal, patronising and simply template replies they send out. Eventually. I leave them feeling frustrated, angry and wholeheartedly disappointed, but in this day and age there is now a lot more choice out there. Why put up with appalling service and couldn't give a toss customer services when you can easily go elsewhere!

            I swear i will never buy anything,  anything from asos again. This is the first but will be the last time. I bought a jumper for £20.60,  including £4.40 discount + £3.00 delivery.  The original price is £22.00. A day later i sent it back as its too big,  requested a smaller size.  They emailed me today saying they didnt have the size i wanted so they refund £17.60 because they deducted discount. So it means i paid £20 odd pounds but was refunded only £17.60 because of their problem????  Is it fair for buyers?  I bought 4 from amazon,  discounted price as well,  but i got full refund when i returned items to order smaller size.I feel like i got robbed.  Shocking customer service.  My sincere advice is NEVER,  NEVER  BUY ANYTHING FROM ASOS.

            Asos used to be my go to site for so many different things. Been a loyal customer for going on 10 years and everything was always great, but after the last order I’ll be seriously reconsidering especially after the complete fudge from customer service with excuses. I ordered something, paid, then got the dispatch email the night before and then the delivery details on the morning of the delivery to only then getting a refund email for one of the items as it was “out of stock”!!?? How can an item thats been picked and ordered be out of stock?As i picked my delivery date to be the weekend instead of next day (tuesday) i seriously believe that they just picked it for someone else who ordered after me and left me high and dry to try and find something else for an xmas present for my girlfriend after all of the same items elsewhere are now out of stock because I wasn’t notified in time!!!

            I ordered once and the item never arrived. They told me they had isolated issues and they were sorry blahblah.. they refunded me timely and it was fine. After almost 2 years since that, I thought I would give the store another chance. WORST MISTAKE EVER... I was supposed to recieve my parcel on nov 10-14th.. and since it didn't I contacted them through chat, and they said due to holidays there were delays, so I had to wait until nov 28th... and I did... and the items still didn't arrive.. So I contacted them.. yet again... and they told me to wait for december 3rd... which I did.. and the item STILL DIDN'T ARRIVE... and so.. I contacted them again via email since apparently the entire site is down or something so there was no chat available.. and they told me to check my address and the local post office and whatnot. Which I OBVIOUSLY DID THE FIRST TIME THE ITEM DIDN'T ARIRVE ON THE FIRST DATE.. and so I responded accordingly and all they could do was send me THE EXACT SAME MESSAGE 3 TIMES... and then.. IGNORE ME ... I am still waiting for a propper response and a refund!!!! I'm really starting to think they will actually rob me!! they've been ignoring my e mails for more than a week now!!!

            I’m not sure what’s all this hype about ASOS about…To be honest, my first experience with ASOS was worse than the one on eBay with the Chinese seller and rating under 90 or it was a complete disaster in other words.After being suggested by my friends for a couple of months straight, I’ve finally decided to try it and buy a nice belt for my husband’s birthday. I’ve purchased not the cheapest HUGO BOSS dress belt and a week later received completely different look belt. On top of that, it seems like it was a cheat attempt, because the belt was chosen similar to the one ordered, expect that it was not Hugo boss but rather than ASOS belt where the ASOS letter on the back was painted black (not to see them). Whilst all this, belt still had the Hugo boss label on it.I’ve tried to contact ASOS and see if there were any quick solution to go around this (as I expected this to be a big mistake and to be dealt urgently), however all I’ve got is that I should send the incorrect item back and they will process my refund upon receiving the item in the next 30 days.For me, this is Hugo boss brand infringement to start with and I would expect ASOS to deal with this case in a much more efficient way.As you can imagine, my birthday gift was ruined and so was my experience with ASOS, so I will never use or suggest ASOS to anyone ever again.

            My experience with Asos was sadly a really bad one, I ordered already a couple of times with asos, but my last one was so disappointing that it will be my last one. I ordered me a nice winter jacket around the black Friday sales event, five days overdue of the promised and paid shipping date I got the message that my package was unavailable to deliver, after contact with the customer service and a made promise that I will get my made purchases resend, I received the e-mail that because of security reasons I can´t get my already paid purchases. After a couple of back and forth emails I let the customer service know that I don´t have interested in a refund but to receive my products, this was sadly ignored and I got refunded. I got the offer that I can rebuy my products but since they weren´t on clearance anymore this time it would cost me 60 $ more which is obviously unacceptable. My emails have been ignored since. Just a giant disappointment and loss of trust :-(

            4 orders in a row that are delivered after the estimated date. For the last they provided an estimated delivery time of 10 days (shipping within EU - long time but I thought ""at least they should not fail this time"") and it's been 15 days and I am yet to receive the order. Contacted CS who told me to wait even longer. I asked if they could contact their courier to understand if there was any issue and the insolent told me ""the courier is yours. I work for asos"". zero attention for customer satisfaction.UPDATE: contacted courier my self who of course told me they could only speak with asos.They eventually agreed to send replacement order that I hope to receive on the following business day (courier already contacted me). But in the meantime it’s been a month to ship something within the EU. My opinion about their customer service (specially their tone and willingness) is very poor.

            Long story short I ordered a size 9us women Chelsea boot I REALLY WANTED and was excited I was able to order since stock was already low. I received the wrong size (Im assuming uk8 since they fit at least 2-3 sizes too big) I chatted with CSR I was told a replacement with the right size would be sent, check email within 48 hrs for further info. After about 4 days still no email I chatted with CSR again, only to be told too bad so sad the item is out of stock, send back your pair for a refund. Only problem is I ordered the shoes because I REALLY wanted them, I expressed thoroughly how a refund would NOT make me happy- I want my shoes in the size delivered! CSR could of at least attempted to take some sort of responsibility with some type of coupon or something. I dont see how the, sending me the wrong size when I ordered correctly results in me ending up as an unsatisfied customer. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they have a good catalog, but it serves them no good if they advertise what they don't have or cant deliver on.

            I have been shopping with ASOS for several years and use their premium delivery option (next day delivery on any order for £9.95 per annum).I was surprised to see so many bad reviews, as I have never had any major problems. I recently accidentally deleted a 15% discount off email for my Birthday. I used their live chat to let them know and they promptly sent me another discount code via email. I get texts and emails letting me know when the delivery will arrive. I think it's a great online shop.

            ASOSThis is the first time I'm using social media to complain about any kind of company. I'll start from the end: Asos is making me pay for their mistake, and I'm paying with my time, energy and money.Two weeks ago I made an order on the website, then forgot to insert a discount code, and I immediately canceled it. I received confirmation for the cancellation which said the order status has been updated to 'cancelled'. However, a few hours later I received an email saying the order is on its way. Reaching Asos's costumer service, I was explained that there was a glitch in the system proceeding the order, and there is nothing they can do to cancel it (approximatly 3 hours after the order was placed).The only way I can get a refund is to wait for the package to arrive, return it myself, wait until it will get back to Asos (up to 21 business days), and then wait an additional 5-6 business days.Alongside spending my time and energy on e-mailing and for the return itself, I have to pay for duty taxes and the bank's foreign coin commission.At first, asking about the delivery payment, Asos took responsibility. When I asked about duty taxes (37 GBP) Asos costumer care stopped replying. I am at my last hope regarding this. I am out of ideas on how to not lose money for a mistake I am not responsible for in any way. Hoping this post could somehow help move things along and avoid any more losses on my behalf.

            Have ordered now twice from Asos after moving to Stockholm in Sweden. Both times the delivery experience has been awful, first time paid extra for next day delivery - First of all it didn't arrive the next day, second I was not informed anywhere that I actually need to be home the whole day on the day they will deliver to be able to receive the order, or otherwise I won't be able to collect it from anywhere until the next time they can try to deliver it to me. Had I known this I could have stayed home and waited for the package since I was going for a holiday the day after. Second time I ordered with a standard delivery, where DHL was the carrier. The order was delivered to a DHL service point 2 days later than promised (overall the delivery took 1,5 weeks) and to a service point that is several kilometers from where I live in. No explanation from Asos why the order has been delivered to this service point and not to one closer to where I live (there are several) or no help with getting the order delivered to a closer pick up point. Also no e-mail or sms from dhl informing about the state of the delivery... Very disappointed with the company, the shopping experience is far from smooth!

            If I could add no stars I would. I would never order anything from asos again. By the time I get my refund on a returned item, it will be close to 3 weeks. They do all their customer service via Facebook messsenger; taking days to get a straight answer. Its an absolute joke. Asos are too tight to have anyone on a phone line. I'd expect business practice like this from an eBay stellar, selling clothes from their bedroom. I wonder, if they had a complaints department, would that be run through tinder?I would recommend no one purchases any item of clothing, unless they have no intention of returning it.

            Took them 3 weeks to admit my order was lost. They then told me they would send a replacement next day delivery. Waited another 5 days and nothing arrived. I contacted them again for them to tell me items were out of stock and the boots would be sent standard delivery 4 weeks after my original order was placed and after saying they would be sent out next day delivery. Boots still not arrived. Terrible customer service AVOID!!

            Always having order issues with asos and the customer service is terrible. Ordered a pair of boots that came faulty. Having spoke to the customer service team they assured me a replacement would be sent through next day delivery. 2 days later and still no boots. Got in contact again and apparently the boots are out of stock. Did not get in contact with me to let me know. Had to chase it up myself whilst they took days at a time to respond. Not the first time something like this has happened with asos. Will not be purchasing from them again.

            I have had multiple issues with ASOS orders. From delays in orders with no explanation as to why, to customer services taking days to get back to me about my order.

            Great customer disservice! They have messed up my orders sending something I have cancelled and cancelling the actual order for a tech failure. After that they told me they couldn't stop the order because it was already  processed (this was a lie since they sent an email 5 days later saying one of the items was unavailable). So they took my payment for an order I didn't want and they didn't block the order from leaving the warehouse in 7 days!Then they told me to send the order I didn't want back to the them and since this was not my fault I could send them a proof a postage to have issued the refund asap. Obviously nothing of this happened. I still didn't get my money back despite sending an order in first instance wasn't supposed to leave the warehouse back with proofs of postage. It's worth to add that in all this process I have been ping ponged from a customer service to the other, staying hours waiting for chats or their calls. also funny, if you have been put in the call queue through the chat and you contact them again through chat to ask why they didn't call you they will automatically kick you out from the call queue and the queue is said to be up to 24h. When I have spoken with them, everyone was saying different things and the girl at the phone was very rude. after they have started ignoring me and they replied to my messages just when posting publicly on FB. So what to say more? I have shopped asos a few times and Variety of items is good but the management of this company is awful, personally I have an order supposed to arrive today not with me and around £100 in their hostage...I would recommend to buy your stuff somewhere else.

            Ordered a top and chose to pay for next day delivery. The next day I received an email to say my order was ""on its way"" to me. Eight hours later an email arrived to say ""sorry your delivery has been delayed"". End of emails...So after stupidly waiting 2 days I message ASOS to ask for news. A day later they sent apologies, but they'd investigate and said ""please allow for 2 working days for a response"".Two days later no news, so I chase. The reply was ""your parcel is being returned to our warehouse for an automatic refund...please allow for 7 working days for it to arrive at our warehouse...it can take 5 working days [thereafter for the cash] to appear in your account"". As they didn't ask me if I wanted it returned I assumed they'd lost the parcel and were just using ""returned to warehouse"" as an excuse to hold on to my money. They have now sent me a dpd link to prove the parcel is on its way back to them (not me!) and I got an email from paypal to say ASOS are not refunding my delivery charge of £5.95. The pain continues!

            First time order on 27th November on standard delivery. Original date was 29th but then it changed to 5th December which is a farcical lead time of 8 days. 5th December and still no order. My account on ASOS has no order number, no tracking details and no order update details. I won't ever use them again, I get most of my stuff from Surfdome and will go back to their exceptional service. How long can a company stay in business with service like this. I spent £175 with ASOS and still no sign of my stuff.. Very poor indeed and stay away and look elsewhere.

Called the delivery company after 2 days they answered to the phone after listening to their robot for 20 min and told me that the label on the item has been damaged and i will not receive it, and that i should contact asos. I contacted asos and they told me they will give me the discount to buy it again and that i should wait 21 days to get a refund but i can order it again after already having it paid. Never again!!!

            I've placed a few orders with ASOS and when there are no issues it's a good online experience, and they have a very good app. However, my most recent order, there has been an issue which is in no way my fault and when I've contacted ASOS the customer service has been very poor. Spent 30 minutes on their chat system, received zero apology and was basically told they couldn't help at all. It was not what I expected, however reading some of the reviews on here now clearly I'm not alone!

BEWARE when you pay for the whole year next day delivery option you don’t always get next day delivery as I’ve just found out and there’s no refund or apology for itAlso returns take ages to process- I was told item not yet reclaimed back then I sent them the tracking number that confirmed it was received 3 days ago-even then after they finally confirmed they had received the item back I still had to wait a further 4 days for it to go through their process which then only raises the refund that can take another 7days on top!

I returned everything but was told they hadn't received everything. The problem was they had sent a replacement which was the dame dodge item I had not ordered. They tried to keep my money for this hideous plastic skirt they even sent it to me twice!!They had no lawful basis to withhold my refund but they have and I am taking this further.

            If I was judging them on there clothes and price point I'd probably give them a solid 4 out of 5. There customer service however below par. Some staff are quite rude, probably stressed and under paid but hey ho. There courier service they use, hermes are really bad. You cannot collect from there depot, you cannot track there courier by gps location, they do not give estimated delivery times, you cannot change an address or time etc. Asos also have very poor relationships with their couriers. Asos cannot change a delivery address and cannot contact their couriers to request they change a delivery address. So with Asos what let's them down is the processes, the couriers and the restrictions the staff work in which do not unable them to provide the best customer care, i believe this is why they can be rude sometimes. On the plus side I quite like the clothes and pricepoint, it's only when an issue arises is where Asos show there weakness.

            I would never order again from them., Ordered two pair of uggs so spent 340+1 pair great. 2 no pair right box but wrong boots.. when I phoned to get an exchange.. I was told to wait 48 hours for them to respond after looking into it? In the meantime I asked for a pair to be put on hold for me. As the boots were selling fast..They wasn't able to do this! Unless I purchased another pair of boots? They also couldn't guarantee to have them in stock once they had investigat their problem . Nor that the next box would have the correct boot either..I asked to speak to a manager,  or for a manager to phone me(as they have no phone no to call). This too had a 48 hour wait.. this is all done by instant messaging.. had to go elsewhere in the end.. still didn't receive a call or email from them . Disgusting customer services.. Not the employees fault.. it was out of their hands.. there just wasn't any way for them to help me

            Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Waited for two weeks for delivery with endless promises that my order would be arriving soon. They eventually admitted that they had never even sent the order but that a replacement would be sent immediately. That was a week ago and still no sign of anything arriving.No answers to any of the emails I sent so I had to call their call centre to actually get someone to deal with and every time I was told a different story.

            Asos was good some 6 years ago now it's a joke. 2 consecutive orders each of 200 EUR never arrived. They keep  telling you to wait long after the estimated delivery time. Once I ordered dresses for a holiday didn't get any, now in November for my birthday, didn't get any. They should just close down there's plenty of other stores around that are very efficient like Zalando, Yoox and singular brand shops. Bye bye ASOS

            Ordered a dress one week ago and was expecting it today, when I didn't recieve it I thought I would investigate so I looked at my asos account to see delivery status only to find out there was 'order issues' . Wasn't sure if that meant it was sent or not so reached out to two different customer care reps and that was proven pointless as the only help they could offer me was apology after apology. I was told to re order and get express shipping if i needed it in time for next weeks event. Went to renorder and the item was out of stock! Why wouldn't they email me and notify me so I could re order straight away. Furious. Honestly don't waste people's time.

            This is an aobhorrent company. I placed an order on Asos for the first time well ahead of the time I needed the items. I checked yesterday to find out the status of my order and discovered that there was NO trace of it in my Asos account. I checked Paypal and saw that Asos had actually cancelled my order, without even letting me know! When I reached out to a customer rep on the chat he literally ignored every single question I had, literally didn't investigate anything. All he kept saying that he needed a ""confirmation number"", which I obviously did not have. Why would Asos have sent a confirmation number AFTER they rejected my order?I reached out to Asos again today, and was told that my order was rejected due to a technical issue. No explanation as to why I wasn't informed. Nothing. I was forced to reorder the items and when asked if they could at least expedite it, they said no. When I asked for store credit for the expedited shipping ""we don't do store credit"". When I asked for a code to waive the expedited shipping cost he said ""we have none"". After pushing, he said he can give me code to use to for shipping reimbursement AFTER I've paid for expedited shipping and RECEIVED my clothes. When I asked if the shipping reimbursement is guaranteed if I use the code, he ignored my question. Then he told me I should wait two days before I need the dress, if there is no ""tracking update"" then we can explore further steps. Unreal.So I was forced to shell out a lot of money to expedite an order I need in a few days. When I received the shipping information, Asos added 3 days to their processing time because of the black Friday sales, so it looks like my order will arrive days after I need it. Guess I'll just be the  bridesmaid wearing a completely different dress from the rest.Amazing.

            ""Computer says no."" Common sense would allow a cancellation period of at least 24 hours when you're not going to be delivering the item for 8 long days, but their ridiculous computerised system lacks this. An 8-day delivery window is too late for my needs, and to add insult to injury, I have subsequently found the  dress in question on the Reiss website at £65 cheaper than on Asos. £190 from Asos, £125 from Reiss.I think it's over between me and Asos.They have outpaced themselves. They had the edge over many other companies but have now sabotaged themselves with inefficiency, unable to keep up with demand or implement a user-friendly customer service ethic.

            UPDATE ON MY REVIEW BELOW:I updated my 1-star to a 3-star (really, 3.5 but I couldn't justify a 4-star as my experience with this one was horrible and stressful).After the below took place, Asos did send me a package that arrived the following two days.  I'm glad the articles arrived before my event so I give them credit for that and I'm very thankful.  However, going through the stress and worrying about what dress to wear to an event is a horrible thing to experience.  Not to mention, the hassle you had to go through to ""chat"" with their customer service.  I was on chat with them for at least 30 minutes pleading my case. **************************AVOID SHOPPING AT ASOS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY.   To make this review simple:1)  I paid for 2-day express shipping for extra $12;2)  I received confirmation that my package was delivered, ONLY IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.  Delivered in Texas, I'm in California.3)  They are sending me a new shipment but will get to me days after I actually need the items I ordered.  **crossing my fingers that I actually receive the package**4)  I asked for them to send the new shipment to me via 2-day shipping since I paid for it.5)  They won't send it via 2-day shipping.4)  They won't refund me back my express shipping fee. This is not the first time that I've had a recent problem with ASOS.  I've been a customer for years and never had issues but for some reason, their customer service has changed in the recent months and this is the last time I'm ordering from them.

            No customer service when it came to getting a refund on a damaged item.  When I asked to get in touch with a supervisor, I was informed that their supervisors were not “customer facing.”  How convenient.

            I have shopped with ASOS for years and found them to be excellent. However, I recently placed an order and was sent an incorrect item. I wanted to re-order but the item was then marked out of stock. A very unhelpful customer service representative on an online chat told me that there is nothing they could do to help and couldn't let me know when the item is back in stock. I wanted to make a complaint but apparently all of their customer service is now based online and there is no way of getting in touch over the phone which I find strange for such a large company

            I have ordered a few times off ASOS and have several points for future buyers to note.1) The ASOS branded clothes are cheaply made - avoid at all costs2) Their designer selection is great but often out of stock3) The customer service to Australia is poor - you have to use web chat or email. They are unwilling to assist with order issues once it is shipped and will make you liaise with the carrier.4) Several times I have ordered off ASOS and eithera) They have delivered to the wrong addressb) Sent me the wrong orderc) Did not specify they would be using a courier instead of their previous option of Royal Mail to ship goods and hence could not deliver to a Parcel Lockerd) Had missing items in my orderNot once have they offered compensation. I have learnt my lesson. Avoid ASOS at all costs!!

However i tried to do my christmas shopping as usual and I was locked out of both my accounts!!! When i contacted the Customer service they told me the fraud team has decided to block my profil because it looked suspiscious, NON SENSE! I worked in a fraud team before, when the investigation is done you either confirm the fraud or release the client's profile. ASOS even said they took a ""Business decision"", so it's a business decision to shut down a genuine client??? UNBELIEVABLE!!!

            So just a few days ago, we ordered a pair of Adidas Original Gazelle shoes that were reduced from £75 to £52.50These were ordered as they were a product that were fantastic value for money at that price. Click and collect from a local newsagent was selected to make sure these were delivered efficiently and without paying for unnecessary delivery. Here’s where the issues came in. The item was consistently delayed until contact with the customer service team at ASOS was contacted. Suddenly the item was returned to their warehouse. Rather than resend the item, ASOS told us that we could reorder these as they were in stock, and after 10 days our current order would be refunded. However, reordering these would cost the original £75. So it seems apparent that these trainers were not sent out, and that ASOS decided to give no option but to spend an extra £20 to complete the order. Will not be using them again as they tried to unfairly dupe us out of the price we had ordered at the time. Awful service

The only issue i did have is my ASOS 'A lister' dropped down a level because i hadn't ordered in around a month? which is a bit disappointing considering i ALWAYS order with them and spend a lot. After having ANOTHER, TERRIBLE experience with Misguided i really do appreciate the easiness of using ASOS and their customer service (Like i said i have never had any issue when dealing with them).

So I made the purchase, it’s was a day later and I never received a email to confirm that it been shipped so I contact them again ASOS told me it would arrive on time. It was the 9 November and it never came I contacted ASOS at 4pm and asked them where was my parcel they told me it would be delivered that day between 4 and 10pm at night and of course it never came. It was the 10 November and still no suit my boyfriend had nothing to wear for Raceday and had completely ruined the whole event. When I contacted ASOS AGAIN they told me it wasn’t coming till the 16 November??? A whole week later but told me the day before that it would arrive on time, I asked for refund they refused until I got the parcel but I decided if the suit fit that I would still keep it. Well I never even got the parcel the only that turned up was the tie i was missing the suit jacket, vest and pants and when I contact ASOS about the missing items on the 18 November they sent me other tie after clearly stating that I ONLY RECEIVED A TIE and was still missing the other items. They sent me another email saying they we’re sending a replacement straight away and I would receive the suit soon. But then got I email from PayPal saying they refund the suit jacket, pants and vest, but not the tie i was confused. Anyway the next day they emailed me to tell me they were out of stock so they were giving me a refund that I asked for weeks ago. I went through all this stress for nothing hands down the worst experience ever, I thought I was doing the right contacting ASOS to make sure I would get my order they promised be not once but 4 times but clearly I was wrong they just lied and told me what I wanted to hear so they didn’t have to deal with it. I will never buy anything from this company again and if you are expecting to receive the items you paid for then you will not purchase from this company too.

            Poor customer service. My NUS card doesn't work when ordering. The help function takes you through to their chat. I spoke with someone who assured me that my query would be dealt with within 48hrs. 3 days went by and I heard nothing, not even an acknowledgement via email. I used chat again and was told I had to wait another 48 hrs, the NUS deal is only on for another day! I wasn't given any reason why my query wasn't dealt with in the original timeframe. This is poor in comparison to other fashion retailers. When I asked for an email address to contact ASOS on, I was told there isn't one.

            Their Customer Service just like something in a Franz Kafka novel - so frustrating that one could easily lose the will to live!!I ordered some goods to be shipped to my daughter in another country and because (i think) the billing address and delivery address were so far apart, they blocked my account due to ""suspicious activity"" being detected. I could not log in to access any information and was unsure whether the order was being processed. Days of emailing them ensued.  Every email told me to log in and change my account details.  They were simply not reading my replies or understanding my problem.. i think the replies were automated responses.  In the end I just gave up.

The estimated delivery time was Nov 16th - the parcel arrived on Nov 15th after i had to pay duty taxes - and then to my surprise i have received some hair pins instead of my shoes !!! the company send again the shoes and requested me to pay taxes again !!! even though i clearly mentioned taxes were paid. The company admitted it their mistake but never took responsibility and is not willing to make a refund. I did not get my shoes and of course i do not plan on paying taxes again. its a shame the company does not take any responsibility !!!

            Wish I could give no stars. Not sure what's happened to ASOS lately but the service is horrific now - I mean really, stuff you couldn't even make up because it's so unrealistically bad.  Not delivering things but insisting they have, not refunding things for weeks (telling me they haven't received the items when I arranged a collection through them - and then the onus is one me to prove!), every email I send is replied to by a different person (possibly automated responses), they've changed the website to MAKE IT HARDER TO ARRANGE A RETURN (!!), no customer service phone number, everything I want is always sold out (take it off the bloody site then).I'm closing my account, I keep romanticising about the old days but it's too much of a liability now and they do not deserve my business. Even if they occasionally get it right - there's more chance of aggregation these days.

            I love ASOS. I have been ordering through them for a number of years now and I have no complaints. The delivery is always really quick. I have returned products that weren't right or arrived damaged without much effort. It is quick and easy. I was very impressed when I had to return a Bridesmaid dress (I had bought it for my sister) because she had got pregnant and didn't fit into it anymore. The dress had been purchased about 5 months prior and they still issued me a refund. I wasn't expecting that. In fact I was hoping for at most an exchange.Ultimately ASOS may not always deliver perfect goods but they always resolve any issues and I for one am very happy with the service.

            I wouldn't return faulty items for replacement as you might not get it back.The replacement process for me has involved 8 contacts with different customer service advisers at every point. I was told at first that I would be sent a replacement and that I should return the faulty item. I returned the faulty item and didn't receive anything after 8 days (3-5 day delivery expected). A refund for my purchase was then issued and I was told the item was no longer in stock. I contacted asking why I wasn't told this at the time (as I would've kept the it and made do). After 5 contacts I was finally told that the return/replacement department has a 48 hour delay and that the item must have gone out of stock in that time. I was not given a replacement and since ASOS was the cheapest retailer for this item I had to purchase the same item for much more elsewhere. I lost a significant amount of time dealing with the complaint and ended up spending more money than I wanted.The item in question was from Rains and could've have been replaced under their 12 month warranty has ASOS used it. The item is still in production and it seems that the item is only out of stock because ASOS don't wish to sell it anymore.Unacceptable processes behind the scenes led to an unacceptable outcome and this will likely happen again to other people.

Had response to give me order number, but no explanation why not received originally. Now move on to their delivery company of choice Hermes.

They were quick to help and I sent them pictures and they gave me a refund immediately. They were kind and courteous on the phone and eager to help.

            I will never order from ASOS again. I ordered two items for a Halloween costume in early October (keeping in mind that it would take a couple of weeks to ship) and got a notification that my items were shipped on October 10th and would arrive in Canada by October 30th. It is now November 9th and my package is nowhere to be found. I contacted customer service twice, and not only do they not know where my parcel is, but they will not even submit a refund until November 15th ""just in case it still turns up"". By November 15th this will have been a 5 week + shipping process, which is completely ridiculous for a company as large as ASOS. I highly recommend finding other places to shop that do not treat their customers this way.

            I usually have good experiences with ASOS but my god they need to put better people in their customer care department who actually give a crap about you. DPD has lost my package and ASOS has the gall to make me wait 3-5 working days for an update on where the hell it is. I spent over £300 on this order which means I should have gotten next day delivery but ASOS doesn't care to rectify this straight away. They want to make me wait for this order for 3-5 working days! They have refused to send me a replacement. Funny thing is, I contacted them yesterday, when the package should have arrived, saying DPD has already told me they lost my parcel and 'Hollie' said contact us again after 10pm to make sure you don't get it when DPD had already confirmed to me that it was lost! They are lazy, slow and careless and as a regular customer, I'm shocked by their service.

            Have only had good experiences with asos. More recently I returned some boots & was refunded within a couple of days. I received an order today & I'm really happy with both the delivery & the items. I'm use asos for the 'curve' range which is excellent. I've always dreaded shopping for clothes, choice on the high street & online are poor & ive always ended up settling for stuff that I'm not entirely happy with. Asos offer good choice & quality that are actually fashionable unlike other stores with ranges for curvy girls. Nothing frumpy. Postage is free over £20 also which is a plus. I'd recommend to my friends, happily.

            ASOS customer service is the absolute worst. I places an order during the Halloween sale, checked out, paid for it, and 3 hours later got an email saying 1 of my items was out of stock, and the whole order was canceled. I asked CS which item was out, and they told me to replace my order because check out had technical issues. Well, they had already charged me for the order, so I ask for a refund. CSR claimed, then, that the order didn't go through because my card declined. I argued that I had paid with Paypal, and I see the charge on my statement. He dismissed me and said if I still wanted the order, everything was back in stock... NEVER ORDERING FROM ASOS AGAIN!  This was 4 days ago. Still no redund.

            Awful customer service, all they care about is themselves. I lodged a missing delivery and they said they would raise an investigation with DPD which could take 3 - 5 days, when I chased on day 6 I was told because I wasn't the account holder (me and my sister share an account) that they couldn't discuss it any further with me. Why it took them 6 days to realise this is beyond me and not my fault and the end of the day. So then my sister spoke with them and they said ""they would raise an investigation with DPD which could take 3 - 5 days"" to which I was outraged as I had already wait 6 days! They should resolve the clients issue first and deal with DPD separately, I should not be out of pocket and without my items because a delivery driver couldn't be bothered to do their job. I have shopped with them for years an have never had an issue to now, but it will stop me using them.

            Irish customers- DO NOT order from ASOS!! Save yourself the hassle, it’s just not worth it!  You have to wait weeks and weeks for a refund and customer service send some robotic responses making the whole situation more frustrating 😡 It takes 14 days (!!!!!) for an item to be sent back by parcel connect from Ireland to the UK which is absolutely shocking service when I can get items here in Ireland from the UK in 2-3 days!! That is a really bad service contract designed only with the retailer and courier in mind! When you contact customer service for an update they say it’s the courier company’s fault and the courier says it’s the contract they have with the retailer so to hell with the customer! They are more than happy to quote terms and conditions put in place to cover them and you can wait for your money back! I’m weeks waiting and no joy, well that’s me done with ASOS, I’ll spend my money with a retailer that appreciates its customers. I wonder do retailers actually read these reviews?!!

            Absolutely terrible customer service. I ordered items to be delivered with 2 day express shipping. I never received them. No tracking information listed on my ASOS account. I contact customer service and they transfer me to their ‘delivery team’ tell me to wait 48 hours. I wait, nothing...I contact them again they transfer me AGAIN. Still nothing. At this point I’ve asked for a full refund, but I honestly don’t expect to get it. I have ordered with them in the past and never had issues. Not sure what changed, but I will never order another item from this company again.

            Worst experience ever . I read the bad reviews and thought “it won’t happen to me “ but it did . I ordered my items October 21 2017 I waited for my 4 day shipping then no package was delivered on the date it was suppose to come October 25 th .  so I emailed them because (they don’t have a number that I could call to ) and they said sorry it will get their October 26 , so I waited Nothing came I emailed once again , the said sorry it will get there October 28 th , NOTHING CAME. I contacted them again they said your package will come November 2 , so I called uPS and they said it was a lie ! You iteam was never shipped and so I emailed them extremely upset because I needed the outfit for an event , they said they needed to open an investigation because the package was lost . I was furious , I love shopping online and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ITEAM FROM THIS WEBSITE AGAIN. If your reading because you really like something on the website please please don’t get it as much as you like it , it’s not worth it . If you want your money back as soon as possible contact your card customer service they will be sure to refund your money as soon as possible unlike ASOS who takes 30 days to give you a product and your money back .

            Ordered a pair of boots from Asos and made an error on my address,  one line. I corrected the error in my account and contacted  Asos regarding the error and the fact on the Hermes tracking page there was an issue with it. I was directed to Hermes, Hermes directed me to Asos - who basically said it's your fault and you'll eventually get a refund. All I tried to do was let Hermes and the courier know the error. Clearly there is no communication between the two. Won't order from Asos again.

Can’t speak to the delivery company and just get fobbed off with a 48 hour rule for replying to you. Cant speak to any manager level person without waiting 24 hours.

Which I have done. Parcel has still not arrived. I have checked everywhere and my parcel is nowhere to be found. I asked for a refund and i get inundated with excuses and reasons to not give it to me. Now i have to wait another day to ""be sure"" and check with my neighbours etc and more timelines added that i have to adhere to. Dealing with Asos has been the most appalling service I have ever had. They are very happy to take your money but will avoid the subject of a refund as much as they possibly can. I will never order from asos again and i will make sure anyone I know doesn't either DO NOT order from Asos unless you are willing to give a limb for delivery fees to get so much as decent tracking information

            Paid for Premier - do not expect your order will come on time. The order was meant to be delivered today with NEXT DAY DELIVERY. However, received no updates about it until 6pm, and said the order will be delivered tomorrow. WHAT IS THE POINT FOR PAYING THE PREMIER? Had the most annoying conversation with the customer service - SOPHIE! Rude, not answering questions, end the conversation without asking the customer ""is there anything else I can help with?""...

I already felt weird about that but I checked my account and it says there that ny order is there and due to be delivered the next day. However around 12:30pm I still haven't got anything so I decided to contact their custoner service to shockingly find out that my order has been cancelled due to technical problem and YET I didn't receive an email or anything that it's been cancelled. I needed that top for today as it's for a gift to my friend and now I had to improvise and look for other gift just because of their system messed up. This kind of service is very unacceptable to think that asos is supposed to be a trusted website but NOT. I'm still waiting for my money that they took right away to be back in my account.

            I have been an ASOS customer for a good few years and always found them to be reliable and helpful until recently. I purchased a dress online for my girlfriend to attend a wedding in a few days time. Upon arrival it was the wrong dress sent that had a similar name on the website but a completely different fit, my girlfriend was understandably quite worried about the imminent event so I called customer services. They told me that they could not issue any sort of refund until I went to the post office and sent the item back, despite me explaining that I needed the correct item with a very quick turnaround, so I was told my only option was to re order the dress after being assured that it was highly unlikely for this sort of error to happen and I would need next day delivery. I ordered again and the item arrived the day before the wedding, unbelievably the wrong item again leaving my girlfriend with nothing to wear and me out of pocket twice. I called again and was told I would need to return another dress and all they offered for the trouble was a pathetic 15% discount that has a one month expiry. I will most likely not be using asos again, everything from the repeat issue with two consecutive orders to the company having absolutely no resolution to make my life easier has completely put me off. I also then had to rush around the shops the day before the wedding to find a replacement instead of enjoying the build up to the event. I think if you are purchasing clothing online there are more reputable and reliable services since this company's decline.

            No Customer ServiceThe same as most internet shops I suppose - Great when you're handing over cash but useless when you have a problem. Every jacket I own is the same size, I ordered one recently and it was tiny. No problem I thought, they got it to me in a day so exchanging won't be an issue. I took it to the post office first thing the day after and have now been told it will take 7 w/d for them to process the return and another week for the replacement. Unless of course... I lend them another £80 to look after for a few weeks, even though I have the PO proof of postage. In that case, I can have the right one tomorrow. Won't be using them again.Also, why have online chat if they do nothing but copy and paste the FAQs!?

            I loved and still do love asos their app is so convenient the layout is brilliant the sales and rewards schemes are great, the variety is also amazing however recently they’ve really started slacking in customer service and helpfulness and even notifying on your orders progress and I am sick of sick of it. Literally just now I got of a chat with the customer service help team and they didn’t offer any consideration or helpfulness or apology for the fact my order has not arrived and I have had no tracking information about why not or how it hasn’t left the sorting hub in four days from being despatched to them to only investigate and inform it they can’t help because it’s a postal delay and I have to wait an extra week!! I wanted my order for an event The next day I had ordered it with plenty of time to come for my event and it was expected to arrive a day ago and there was no apology or any suggestion of discount or free delivery next time only that they’d let the courier service know I’d like notification of postal delay next time. And they fact is even if I cancelled and returned the order I would have to wait over a week for a refund to be processed. I am so livid and this isn’t the only time they haven’t done anything to resolve the situation or make me happier about a situation they caused from being an informative useless company with no customer sympathy and awful service. Last time I returned soemthing because it was the wrong size and requested a new size only to get an automated email saying a refund was being processed so I had to contact and find out the size I wanted was out fo stock and rather than them putting on hold the size when it is back in stock and sending it out suggest I buy something different in there end of season sale which I did not want.

            I used to love Asos but this year it really has gone down in service.An order in June had items with wrong sizes.An order in August had completely wrong items.An order in September didn't arrive. I contacted customer services and they would investigate and send out a new order. That investigation never happened and nothing was sent. Then I contacted asos again a week later and after an hour on the chat the finally offered to reorder and sent it with next working day delivery (international/Europe). The whole chat was a pretty bad experience. After that I was pretty fed up, but then I was going on a trip and I wanted some dresses from the tall section. So my order in October. Again not delivered. Tried customer services again. Very unhelpful. It's Monday today and I'm leaving Friday. All she offered was - a 48h investigation and send out a replacement after that (which wouldn't arrive in time)- Cancel the order and I reorder again and they give me free next day delivery (I used a sale discount code which was not available anymore so I'd end up paying more for my order). On top of that it would take them 5-10 working days to refund the original order. It was quite a large order so nice sum for Asos to be sitting on twice. - Cancel the order. I asked to speak to a manager. The customer service rep Molly was pretty unsympathetic, didn't even respond to half my concerns and then ended the chat abruptly. Save to say I'll now think 3 times before ordering from Asos again. I'm really fed up to be honest. And incredibly frustrated. I used to be a big, big asos fan. But their customer services really lets them down.

            I have been getting my clothes here for a few years. But suddenly my account was blocked and it took them over a month to help me out. I sent so many emails, tried to get help over facebook but nothing. Everytime you contact them its a different person and they are just made me go through circles.

            Half of my wardrobe and skincare stuff is from Asos. They have amazing stock and an efficient costumer service. I live in Colombia, so I'm not an UK or US costumer, my location is often a problem when I shop online but not with them.

            IF YOU WANT NEXT DAY DELIVERY DO NOT USE ASOS I have used this company for the first time and won't be using them againI ordered an item that cost £180, the site had a promotion for free next day delivery which I qualified for. I placed my order and I chose a shop for my order to be delivered to as I was not going to be in all day and thought this would be easier HOW WRONG could I be I got a text to say my order had been dispatched  and I could track it So I did and I was put through to the Hermes site and I can see that my order has been sitting there in the national sorting hub since 6:19 this morning.......so I tried to contact hemes but they say as it's an online purchase I have to contact the seller which I did only to be told by asos live chat that there was nothing they could do until after 10pmSo I got back on after 10 pm only to be told that out off the 3 delivery company's they use hemes are the only ones that they are not allowed to have contact with ....... what a poor excuse and to top it off I have to wait now untill the 24th October to see if my goods turn up and then and only then will asos be able to help me,!!! Well they have been NO HELP so far and as they are not allowed any contact with the delivery company can't see what difference the help help will be.

            I ordered 3 items and bought premier shipping. I needed the clothes the next day after it was supposed to arrive. On the day it was supposed to arrive it didn't show up. I was mad because I actually need these clothes. I DM them on twitter. They got back to me and said 'we'll send you an email when your parcel has shipped.' The next day they send a DM saying my order was not successful even though my card was charged the full amount days earlier. Very disappointing. If you need clothing by a specific day, don't buy from ASOS.

            Paid €30 for a dress for an event and received the complete wrong dress, then I had to go out last minute to buy a replacement. How do you mess up an order of 1 item???

            I have never experienced such bad service. They have used an un-reliable courier company who shipped my package back to the UK without my consent. The customer service team told me to track it down myself. No apologies or even store credit was offered as compensation (not that i'd use ASOS again) I have never had such little help from there customer service team. I would highly recommend using any other fashion brand. Like literally, any other brand. Now something I required for an event tomorrow will not be here. Thanks for nothing ASOS. I'll just do half your job for you. No need to pay me.

            ASOS is a horse sh***t of a shopping site, its basically a coin flip if you will get your order or not. I mean take a look of the rating from costumers, excellent and great gets = 43% while Poor and bad gets = 51% and Average = 5%. Thats a coin flip in THEIR favour. I ordered simple sweaters, and with just few quantity aswell. (2 pieces) I was supposed to get them 27th September, never got it. I've been in contact with the costumer service trough email, the package is lost, or so they say (bet they never had it in stock), so they sent a replacement. I was supposed to get it 19 October (the same 2 pieces) Still don't have it. For anyone who's reading, don't take your chances with it. Did i mention i'm basically UK's nabour-country? So the fact that i still haven't got my package is beyond me.

            absolutely shocking - Remember when asos used to be great. Gradually got worse over the years, been a premier customer for at least the last 5 years. Ordered item next day delivery usually comes with DPD and comes to my place of work, so they decide to send with UK Mail who give me a nighttime slot of 6pm - 10pm. So i thought open a chat, well the girl who was on the chat was rude had a poor attitude and tried to cut me off. Asked her for her full name she refused, i asked her numerous times can she liase with UK Mail to have the address changed which she told me no plenty of times. Its basically tough luck and when the same happens the next day and i am not present for this 4 hour window when my parcel will come that it will go back to there warehouse, i couldn't see how this helped me in any way and i was very patient with the girl, Raquel her name was. Further down the chat she tried to cut me off and close the chat window, very abrupt and rude. She then advising ASOS  can liase with UK Mail however that i need to close the chat and email them, when i asked for a email she refused to give me one, I have kept a transcript and will be making a complaint to asos. The rep even told me no advisor would tell me any different, she was not even willing to try and help. So the lesson is if you try and anticipate the delivery like me and have it delivered to your work, then they send it out with a second rate courier that their hands our tied, dont contact them because its too much hassle for these 'advisors'. Asked for a refund and was ignored despite them being able to recall this from the courier, asked for a email address to complain - refusedI literally am furious at the treatment by this rep and hope she is reprimanded. Still dont know how i am meant to get my order or a refund?

            Ordered Women’s shoes- Puma Basket Heart Trainers in Patent White. They arrived to Israel quickly, before expected delivery date and in perfect brand new condition. I was nervous about the size since i never ordered in UK size before. I am a 9 1/2 US and after reading many reviews that the shoe runs small in size and double checking the comparison of US to Uk sizes I ordered UK 7 and they fit perfectly. I was also extremely nervous after reading many bad reviews about Asos and their terrible reviews about returning and customer service but luckily for me the shoe fits and i do not need to return, phew. I Love my shoes and now thinking about ordering in more colors.. hmmm.

            ASOS has repeatedly sent me the wrong size. I ordered boots in a US size 6 (UK size 4/euro size 37). When my package arrived, I was surprised to find boots in US size 7 (UK size 5/euro size 38). I wanted to make it work, but the boots were much too loose. I understand mistakes happen, so I got in touch with customer service and was offered free express shipping for the trouble and I immediately sent back the wrong pair. 2 days later, the “corrected” pair of boots arrived. I was shocked to find that they were again US size 7. I contacted ASOS for a second time asking for a correct exchange. The customer service rep told me not to bother with another exchange to ensure that I don’t receive the wrong size again. Outrageous! All I wanted were the boots in the correct size. I did not want to return for a refund. I could not believe that I received such a response. What kind of company would prefer to lose a sale rather than correct the order? They also asked for proof that I did select a US size 6 in my order so I provided screenshots. I was told they'd be conducting a 48-hour investigation and would get back to me. Once they got back to me, the boots had sold out online and I received a message stating they would be unable to complete an exchange. They offered me a 20% off discount code that expires in one month. I am disappointed to see that the quality of ASOS has seriously declined. I won’t be ordering from ASOS again. It took an entire month for the return/refund process to finalize.

            I went onto chat to get a better understanding of what size to buy in slippers as there was nothing to help on the website and the operator I was talking to advised a medium for a size 7 so I ordered them and they where too small so I sent them back for a bigger size, No big deal, and then I get an email to tell me i have been refunded cus all sizes are now out of stock but I go on and all sizes are in stock so i hop back onto chat to Montel for some help and he tells me a replacement has been sent out to me in size medium again!! Then proceeds to tell me that the size I asked for was sent. This operator obviously has not got a clue what is going on. I've now tried a different method of communication to see if I can get better clarification of what is actually going on.

I spent $352. Got $100 off making my total $252.  Awesome right!! So we get our stuff, and only have to return 4 items pretty good. So I am waiting forever for my return 2 weeks, finally get it WHAT!!!!  The 4 items I returned totaled $137.50  so here's where the truth of this company comes out, they take the entire $100 I saved on my entire purchase out of that $137.50 refunding me a wopping  $37.50.  Some dishonesty right there!!!  Stealing my money!!! So I start emailing them no response. I'm going over their return policy says nothing of the sort that this is the way they do returns.  So I finally get an email back they could care less, they say because I got that $100 off of my purchase they took it back. I'm like WAIT I still spent $214.50 so should still receive  $50 off  my purchase, then taking $50 off the $137.50 making my true and honest retund $87.50. So they owe me $49.50 I understand thats not a lot of money, that is not the point. Take care of your customers! Be an honest company!!! UMM dont steal money!! I keep e-mailing them,THEY just fight me and argue. I sent proof of their promotion they have all the order history. They just want to steal from me!!!  They sent an email asking if i was satisfied with customer service i said NO WAY and sent it, it came right back as failure to send no response. FRAUD!!!!  LIARS!!! THIEVES!!!

            So ive ordered a big order, they emailed me in the morning before my delivery that woops we are out of stock of your pants, after i paid for them, so after that i was like whatever i will order new ones, they emailed me again saying they will notify me when they will be near, and will give me a one hour time slot to be ready to collect my delivery so because i havent received that i though ok i will change my delivery adress just down the street to the pharmacy so i could go to work, after literally 10minutes i get an email that they will deliver my parcelvto the pharmacy the next day, why? Turns out the dpd tried, an i cannot stress this enough TRIED to deliver the parcel to the pharmacy but they failed hahaha, so lets figure this out they would of notifed me if they were near with a mesage thats says in the next hour the parcel will be with me, but they didnt, but they were in the pharmacy and deliver the parcel but somehow failed. Yeah i know what a load of bs. Anyway so yeah if you want to spend 200£ get a message that your pants that was suppost to be with a suit are out of stock on the morning of the deliver day and then get your parcel deliver the next day not this day when it was suppostu then suuuuurreee go ahead use asos. Oh yeah almost forgot i contacted the customer service guess what my options are to wait for the parcel or get a refund that will take up to two weeks!! How nice is that hahaha and you know why it will take this long,ill tell you kids sit down, well you see they need to get the clothes from dpd and then they can start my refund, so the jorney from dpd to asos warehouse they said would take about 4 days but somehow they delivered mine in 1 funny huh? So yeah if you want to waste your time and money go ahead.

            Do not use this sham of a company. I ordered stuff for next day delivery it did not come. Then I contacted the customer service and she said I will look into it. I checked again that day and she had cancelled my order. Another rep said all they could do was refund me I said fine and went and ordered my stuff elsewhere. 2 days after my stuff arrived from the other company I switched to I contacted asos again to know where was my refund. She basically told Me to  put up or shut up and that it would take a week for them to get the stuff back in their possession. A further 2 days later I got an email to go and collect my order , this after being told at least twice that I wasn't getting it and I would be refunded. The customer service do not keep a record of your correspondence with them so every time you contact them you have to start from the start again. You can imagine how frustrating that is after nearly a week of it's coming/ it's not/ we refund you/ we don't refund you/ now here's your order

            I have shopped with ASOS for years, very surprised to see such negative reviews. I have had a few issues and as their customer care contact is via email only, this hasn't proven to be so efficient and can be quite difficult which is why I knocked a star off.  BUT, considering the amount of orders I place, my experiences have been positive and I consider ASOS my number 1 marketplace.Next Day delivery is £10 for a year - BARGAIN. I can order at 11pm and my order be with me 9am the next morning.  Impressive and I've never had an issue with DPD deliveries.  I always know where my parcel is and when its arriving. If I won't be in, I arrange for it to be delivered to my shed and I really do get value for my £10.Returns policy - very, very easy process.  I spend thousands per year, my return rate is low but when I have sent things back, I have never had a discrepancy or any issue with the money being refunded.Great variety of products with good range of prices, great delivery and returns process, good rewards scheme for customers......very happy shopper here!

            Sooo I decided to get a student discount code from asos, which went great until i clicked on the verify email sent to my student mail. I never got the code, and now here 3 weeks later i have chatted with my 5th asos employee and there has been an email correspondance as well. So the issue is that i am verifyed to get this code, but they never sent it to me. I have just been in touch which asos through their chat for the 5th time, trying to get my code. and got the same message i got last time. they need another 5 days to sent me my code (which THEY have failed to do for 3 weeks), but no worries they gave me a one time only discount code for the second time, with the message ""happy shopping"". the first one time only code I got and tried to use, my order was cancelled due to credit card promblem (or at least they have stated this, nothing is wrong with my card or the things I've entered). I have loved asos, but their costumer service is not good enough. They kept telling me I got the promo code out of their good will, because they were a good company that wanted the best for their consumers. but I have now spent hours and hours waiting for this code, and for the first time in my life I have started to think that I am about to boycut shopping at a company, this is simply not worth it.

            DO NOT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY WITH ASOS!I buy from many international websites that ship to Israel. ASOS has the worst experience for international shipping to IL I have ever encountered!!! If I don't use express shipping, I need to pick my package up from an old, dusty convenience store in a shady street in my city (why?????). If I order packages that exceed my local customs limit ASOS used the worst company to handle customs. The company is called GCX, they are incredibly slow! I ordered a package a week ago, paid for express shipping and was just notified the package will not arrive for another week. That's 2 weeks for ""express shipping"". In addition, on top of the customs fees (which I am more than prepared to pay), GCX charges a handling fee of 12.5 GBP!!!! No other company does that!!!!I paid a total of 22.5 GBP just to get the package over to me with extremely delayed shipping. BAD BAD experience by all means. PS - contacted ASOS about this many times but they won't take any responsibility.

            I always shop at ASOS but recently it has been nonsense ever since DPD took over. They have delivered my parcel else where and I have checked with neighbours etc and no where to be seen. As usual they are so confused via email and so generic(kept to script) I want a refund for items I did not receive yet they keep telling me no as DPD need to investigate etc. I've shopped there for years with no hassle no issues so why would I all of a sudden make this up? I needed the items for a holiday and relied on my A list next day delivery etc. but nope having issues this week which I was not informed about until I asked multiple times why my other orders are arriving 4 days later. Not happy and this is still ongoing. They're sitting on my money which I could use elsewhere or even on my holiday! So be careful because ASOS is not what they used to be.

            I was sent promotion code for 20% off for my Birthday from them. So I spent an hour looking for items and once I was finished I checked out, only to find that code was not excepted. This was a loss of £14, but I checked out as I thought the customer service advisor would be able to amend. No help from Paul or Charlie the advisors who thought my best option was to go to Flannels, and return the order to Asos. Have I gone mad! Please ignore all promotions from ASOS by email. Sorry got to go to Flannels and get my 10% discount which will work. I’ve have been on the phone to Asos customers service for over an hour trying to get this problem rectified as my delivery note is unreadable for return. The next two advisors said there is nothing they do as they have no way of resending out delivery notes. My only options are to keep the delivery and lose the discount or to pay myself for a return through Royal Mail, which is a total joke. There is NO HELP! Guess what? After waiting a couple more days after my many phone calls of complaint, I retried the 20% off code on a much smaller amount and it worked. So I guess that you can have a 20% Birthday Discount as long as it doesn’t cost them to much money. Just beware please as when it does go wrong, they will not be willing help you. I had to keep my order without the discount, as they can’t or won’t resend out a copy of your order form. This was a loss to me of £14 but a massive learning curve in Asos life. Plus through their advisors I’ve discovers Flannels a utopia of fashion, with much bigger names and even bigger discounts. Thanks Asos!

            Appalling customer service! I have shopped at ASOS for YEARS (from two different countries) and everything used to be great - easy enough return process etc. UNTIL something goes wrong. Doesn't matter if you are and A-List shopper on their site. I specifically needed something next day for an event and was going to pay the £6, but decided I shop there all the time so may as well finally pay the £10 to get a year of next day deliveries. The next day I get an email from DPD scheduling my delivery for the following day (so a day late). Obviously unhappy and going to have scramble to get something else for my event, I chat to 'Louie' on their online chat portal. He openly admitted that it was their fault and they had several packages delayed a day but would not give me any sort of credit. So even when I return the item since it won't arrive in time - I'm out £10! I no longer need the next day delivery because I refuse to ever shop with them again!! Absolute joke of customer service and they have officially lost a long time and frequent customer. I work for a similar e-commerce website and we would NEVER lose a customer or let them walk away feeling like this. They need to reevaluate their business strategy.

Their delivery to UAE (Dubai) is so fast, normally reaches me on the 3rd day of order - on standard delivery option.  The jacket i ordered was faulty at the back and have to request for a replacement,  the customer care (Georgina) helped me with the free return procedure via aramex and the replacement was received 3 days earlier than promised.  It was a smooth process and frankly was so surprised with all the bad comments and reviews.  All the customer care replied within the day and have action my request promptly.Kudos to the Asos team!

            I bought from ASOS twice and always have had issues with delivery. First time I bought something from them, it was supposed to be delivered before the 23rd of December and I get a card from the post office to pick up my parcel on the 8th of January. I didn't really mind because it was Christmas season and so on and delivery usually gets delayed around that time. This time, I bought stuff on the 30th of August and get a mail that the items have been shipped on the 4th of September and that I should be getting them by 15th of September and it's 3rd of October and I am still waiting. Customer care just keeps sending me those generic mails about checking if the postman dropped it in the bin or something like that. They aren't very helpful and they do not tell you if they will refund or reship. I am not buying anything again from them. I am very disappointed.

            Been an ASOS premier customer for a few years and more often than not the next day deliveries are delayed. This happened AGAIN a few days ago where my items were sitting at the depot an hour away from where I live since 8.45 that morning. I never received an email until 4.30 that afternoon to tell me its delayed and will now be delivered 3 days later. These were items specifically needed for an event that night. After 45 minutes trying to contact their customer support (which I couldn't) I managed to get through to the delivery service who had absolutely no answers! ""Its just been delayed, we don't know why."" was the exact response. I explained that I had been waiting since 9am and live an hour away. Why couldn't they contact me earlier and I could have picked the items up myself - again met with a verbal shrug of the shoulders. Ridiculous. I left a message with ASOS customer service on Facebook and have now had 3 replies from 3 different advisors and judging by their response, not one has even bothered to read the complaint. A copy and paste ""Sorry here's 10 percent off your next order"" is all i received. I would say it's bad customer service but I have yet to receive anything remotely close to customer service. I also still do not have my items.Update: Items arrived 4 days late. Have now spoken to 6 separate advisors all of whom have completely ignored any of my questions and refused to take responsibility for the disgusting customer service I have received. Their last response was ""Sorry you don't want the items anymore you can return them for a full refund"". Absolutely shocking service and will not be using again!Update: Now 2 weeks and just been contacted by 'customer care' email after speaking to 12 advisors. One of which even lied to me about how many orders I had made so that they didn't need to refund me (which they still haven't). Still no further forward.

            I spent £160 on Asos and got 6 clothing items plus a bag. They were all the Asos brand except for one blouse, which was from Pimkie. Surprisingly, I love all the items! I got all the items in either UK size 8 or 10, and they all fit nicely. Package arrived one day later than expected, but I won't blame Asos for that since I live in Finland and the post here can be slow sometimes. The delivery from the UK to Finland took 8 days. I think the quality is good for the price. Obviously Asos isn't as cheap as some other online stores, but you get what you pay for. I think the Asos brand is great for pretty basic, but nice good quality clothing. Of course they sell other brands and designer items as well, and the selection is big. Overall, I'm happy with my items and will probably purchase from Asos again!

            I ordered from their website the first time and it will be my last time ever. My order was for an upcoming event but now I have to figure something out, very soon. When they shipped my items, they only have my address as ""Conshohocken, PA"" USA. That is it. Nobody from their warehouse realized the error and I wasn't informed. When they shipped to USA, nobody can find my location and the tracking system is so slow. When ups finally gave me the update about my packege not been able to deliver, it was too late for me to give them my address because they already sent it back. When I contact the ASOS customer service, they said is because nobody answer for the delivery so they can't deliver. Of course they can't. You didn't even give a complete address to the delivery company. I am disappointed with their careless service and handling.

            Ordered a maternity dress for a special occasion.  It arrived with a faulty zip so I returned it for an exchange.  I spoke to somebody at Asos on the Monday & explained I needed the replacement by Saturday.  She said she would issue a replacement immediately.  Thursday I received an email informing me that my account has been refunded.  I spoke to Asos & they explained that they are now out of stock but they haven't bothered to let me know in the meantime.  I now have 1 day to try to source a replacement maternity ball dress ... not an easy task.  Terrible communication & service by Asos.  Will not be using again!

            I ordered a skirt and some trousers at the start of September.  I kept the skirt but the trousers were so small I returned them by their Royal Mail Returns Service.  However, 2 weeks later I had had no correspondence from them to confirm receipt or refund so decided to contact them.  This is where the fun starts as it appears from their website that you are unable to contact Customer Service by phone - only live chat, email or social media.  I'm not on social media and their email didn't work so that left only live chat.  Fine if the Customer Service was able to solve my problem but they said they couldn't.  So I messaged to ask if they'd received my parcel and wanted to know when I could expect the refund (Royal Mail tracking said it had been received).  I was unable to provide the order number to Customer Services as the order receipt had been returned with the parcel, the confirmation email had been deleted from my email account and for some odd reason the order wasn't showing in my ASOS account history (why?).  So basically I was told that they couldn't help me without the order number.  I told her my address, telephone number, what and when I'd placed the order, how I'd paid for it but no - she couldn't help me without the order number.  So I asked what I should do and was told that because of data protection she couldn't help me any further.  I asked for their Head Office address so I could write to them and was told that she couldn't provide this because of security(?!).  So I asked for the Customer Service address but she was also unable to provide this because of security.  I mean what the?!  So what I supposed to do?  No-one to speak to, no-one to write to? So I went on-line and found these addresses myself but left the conversation fuming.  Fortunately, today I have since noticed that my card has now been refunded but the lack of communication after sending the item back and the lack of being able to sort out my simple problem via live chat (only option) has dum-founded me.  Having only made 2 purchases from ASOS in the past this will be my last.

            I paid for next day delivery and the parcel didn't arrive. I checked the DPD tracking and it said that my parcel had been delivered and signed for, which it hadn't. I then contacted ASOS asking them where my parcel was. They said it would take up to 48 hours to get a reply from DPD, so I said this was unacceptable and asked for a refund on the 1 day delivery that I selected as I paid for a service that wasn't provided, they refused. They then proceded to end the chat before I could reply so now I have to wait for them to contact me. I won't be using ASOS again as they have terrible customer service.

            Awful help center. I wanted to track my order (order > $150 USD so tracking is suppose to be possible) as a tracking number was given, but not functional. Essentially, customer service told me that all I can do is wait to see if the order arrives. There was no point in contacting their help center which one can only do by live chat or FB or other social media services. There is no person to talk to on the telephone!! A call center with trained employees and a good system would help EVERYONE! As is, the customer service employee comes off rude and uncaring and the customer is left frustrated and unhappy.Buyer beware that customer service is AWFUL!!!

            Returned jeans (that were very poor quality) via Pass My Parcel on  14 August. I realised that I hadn't received my refund six weeks later. After seven emails to their customer care and a trip back to the parcel shop I eventually received a refund on 22 September. Asos gave me a scant apology, no explanation as to the six week delay and no goodwill compensation for my seven emails and extra trip to the parcel shop. I will never order from Asos again, their customer service is truly appalling.

ASOS carries clothes I cannot find in the states. I took the risk bought $400 worth of clothes held my breath and hoped for the best. Everything was on time. Received in 2 days (no joke,how are they that fast?) perfect condition exactly what I wanted. I was very impressed with this company. I can say no issues with items or delivery.Update: now a frequent shopper! Love this store :-)

            I placed the same order twice. The first time, the package was returned to ASOS, since UPS couldn't deliver it to the given address. I was assured I would receive a refund, which I didn't. I was tryna get my friend a birthday present, so I figured I'd wait for the refund and order again. The second time, the tracking ID provided was for a product from Amazon, and yet again, the package had been returned to ASOS. Returned twice, no refunds whatsoever. I'm out 76 pounds. There was nothing wrong with the delivery address provided since it was for the University of Liechtenstein. It's practically a landmark! And customer service for ASOS is a joke.

Given we were staying in the venue I requested they deliver them there and was assured next day delivery to the venue, for which I provided an address. A week later, at 8pm on the day of the wedding, the ties were delivered to my home address 300 miles from the venue. Offered a refund if I posted them back at my own expense, and 10% off a purchase in the next month. Very unhappy with the service, and only an email to complain via. No phone line to speak to anyone.

            without a doubt one of the most frustrating companies to deal with, can only email or chat online, if you enjoy dealing with idiots who take 5 minutes between each piece of conversation then get on ASOS chat, it will literally blow the head off you how frustrating it can be to do a simple returnquite simply, avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            I placed an order with ASOS for next day delivery. I didn't receive a confirmation email which I thought was odd but I received a confirmation for my payment from PayPal so I assumed all is good. However, the next day when I was supposed to receive my package (Between 7am and 10pm) I waited all day for a despatch email that never came. By 7pm I was agitated and went to the website to find answers. There is no number to call which is frustrating (I was later told they don't have a call centre) so their only means of half decent contact is through a Facebook chat or a live help chat on their website. Generally I have good experiences with live chats so decided to take that route. However I waited around 30 minutes for someone to become available. Every message I sent I had to wait 10 minutes for a reply to, and in the end they told me they couldn't find my account OR my order on their system!! If that wasn't frustrating enough they told me I had to wait within a 48 hour time frame for someone to get back to me! I then decided to go to the Facebook chat where within 15 hours the only response I received ""Are you sure the email you provided is correct?"". So I took to the live chat once again, where I waited another 30 minutes to be spoken to who took even LONGER to reply than the last time for them to tell me the exact same thing the first person told me: They couldn't find the order or my account on their system. The only advice they could give me was to place a new order and for obvious reasons I am skeptical. The issue lies with their system, not with me. After having to provide proof through screenshots to show I had actually placed an order that hadn't been received, the person I spoke to hesitantly offered me a measly 10% discount for my troubles.I am very disappointed with the way this matter was handled and I will never order from ASOS ever again.

            Absolutely shocking customer service! Ordered a voucher for my nephew's birthday. Had to login using my old Twitter account, because their Facebook connection was defunct. No order confirmation, no nothing! Went into their chat. No record of order, despite the fact they took £50.00 from me! Oh, and it'll take 48 hours to sort out. Birthday ruined. Worse was yet to come. Mid conversation with company and they cut me off! I was not abusive once! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE TRULY AWFUL!

            Worst service i ever encountered. They have available dresses that are out of stock. I ordered a blue size 6 dress and i received a pink zise 4 dress. Not even the same model. I returned it back, they didnt answer my messages 5 times after they said they will fix it in 48 hours, after i wrote them last time they said the dress is out of stoc. All this time I could still see it available for someone to buy on their website. They are so bad at communicating ans don't care about their customers. I would never order from them ever again. All this back and forth lasted for more than 10 days just so i don't have a dress anyway and still waiting for my money. The dress is still available now so if someone buys it it won't arrive to them. Sad, dissapointing, the worst!!!

            I have tried to get 3 items from their Autumn 17 catalogue. There customer service do not know if they have ever stocked, or ever will, have these items! All these items are marked with the Asos branding and prices but no one can give me any information, they talk down to me with I have searched and can't find, all things I was well aware of and I had already done, and to check their back in stock daily when we don't even know that these items were ever in stock.they say I should be able to find similar, I don't want similar! I believe thy are guilty of false advertising to get you to look at their site and buy. Anyone know what I can do about this as their condescending answers and refusal to account for themselves are driving me crackers, they are also refusing to send my emails upwards in the management chain to get an answer. also not one of them has referred to the magazine as I have asked.

            I have only ordered once before from ASOS and they delivered by Royal Mail. No problems at all. Ordered again last week, nightmare began. They despatched my item to Hermes. My heart sank. Delivery date of last Thursday came and went. Tracking claimed they had attempted delivery, two people in the house but no-one arrived, no card left, porch as a safe place had they bothered. Same again Friday. I contacted ASOS via live chat on Friday - they asked me to contact them Saturday if nothing arrived. Hermes claim to have tried to deliver again on Saturday morning (I received a text at 8.10 am and then the tracking claims final attempt made at 8.33 am when three people were in the house, again no card left because no attempt was made). Contacted ASOS via live chat again I was told my complaint had been escalated to the specialist team to investigate and would receive a response in 48 hours, if not sooner.  Monday - nothing from ASOS. The item is supposed to be returned to the supplier after three attempts but my Hermes tracking shows it was on its way back to the courier at 5.25 am Monday morning. At 12.07 pm my tracking tells me an attempt will be made between 10.00 am and 2.00 pm!!  At 12.30 pm, you guess it, another attempt was made and yes I was in the house. On-line Hermes chat again, they are claiming access issues - really, there aren't, Royal Mail have just managed to push my mail through the letter box in the porch door!!!  ASOS are being equally rubbish and I now have to wait until Thursday (when the package won't have been returned to them as they are claiming). ASOS could not check their tracking as it had not updated, so sent them the link to mine showing parcel was not on the way back to them. Soz, can't do anything until Thursday, well Friday as I have to wait until close of play Thursday at which point they will investigate for me!!). Thanks a bunch!!

Received a snotty reply saying it was returned only couple of days ago so I'll just have to wait...moron clearly couldn't tell the difference between August and September as an 08 and an 09 date. Once I pointed out that it was returned a month earlier than she though I was messaged by a different girl asking the same questions over again!! She apologied and said she would give me the refund only to then say as my Facebook name doesn't match the account she can no longer give me the refund! Claiming they will breach data protection if they issue a refund...TO THE SAME ACCOUNT THE ITEMS WERE PURCHASED! This is after they have already breached it by going through all the account info with me?!

            Apparently they have no way of communicating with the courier they use - Hermes - so when the inevitable delivery issues occur, they suggest re-ordering as they have no way to find your parcel.

            I ordered the UK2 size, it was really urgent for me. they made the UK3 size looks like UK2 by using a new UK2 tag. I could see it through the product tag. They were supposed to hide this I think. After I ordered that, the UK2 size was suddenly out of stock. I think they don't have UK2 size but they tried to sell it. Customers are not an idiot. I requested to send appropriate size since I HAD TO WEAR THAT NEXT DAY. But, they said they need to collect and investigate that. Now, I have to find new shoes for tomorrow thanks for ASOS's nice solution. REALLY DISAPPOINTED ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE.

            I didn't shop for a while in ASOS as I mostly ended up sending items back but I am going away this weekend and needed pair of jeans ASAP. I've order few other items and ended up spending £200 and got next day delivery. Ive just received everything and was excited to try it on and have a look. In pockets in one pair of jeans i found WASHING POWDER and one of the shirts was very bad quality. I've spoke with customer service and ive sent them a picture. She informed me they can send me replacement in 48-72h, which didn't please me, as im leaving tomorrow and need my stuff now. She said i can order it again for tomorrow and she gave me 10% off code (yuhuuu yeeey....), like my bank account can hold another ASOS order. And extra... the jeans are not even in stock anymore, that's about her offering replacement for me (can't even be bother to check). DONT SHOP IN ASOS. Refund process is long, customer service is sh..., clothes are second hand but charged full price, quility of their own brands...don't let me start on it. Waste of time, waste of money.

            Worst online company out there. Received product covered in DOG HAIR! Clearly been used and was second hand. Spoke to a customer adviser called Elysia. She offered to replace the item and eventually offered a 10% off full price items which anyone can use at any time if they know how (student etc.)Despite sending pictures showing the damaged nothing else was offered even after expalining the situation once again. Think twice before buying from here if something goes wrong they really don't care.

            I am so sad to have to write this about ASOS, but I sent a parcel back 2 weeks ago now and have yet to receive my refund. I sent it back using the prepaid label which I sent through my internal BBC post and....nothing. I spoke to a lady called Danielle online, and she as good as told me to get lost. Apparently this is customer service you get when a company like ASOS finds success. I'm so disappointed in this experience. Beware people!

            WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE A 1 STAR! I ordered $700 worth of clothing and paid for express 2 day shipping. I received my order on the 4th day. The order was missing 11 of the 15 items. I received only 4 items and 1 of those items were DAMAGED. I contacted ASOS immediately and had to beg to have the missing items be shipped to me immediately because I was going on a 3 week vacation. The rep finally apologized and guaranteed that the items would be delivered to me 2 days later (the day I was leaving for vacation). I asked for tracking and he said I would receive it by email. The next day of course I still hadn't received tracking so I contacted ASOS yet again which I got an answer of the items have not been shipped yet and will not make it to you before you leave for vacation. I asked to speak to a manager and the answer is they will contact you within 48 hours and there is nothing else they were willing to do for me. Now i am left with no time to go shopping for the vacation. I will never shop here again. This was the most unprofessional experience.

            Sent me the wrong item that I paid and ordered for next day delivery as I wanted it for the bank holiday weekend. This was a Friday. I asked customer service if they could get the correct item to me before Sunday and they told me no, although if I made a new order and basically paid twice then I could, as it would take at least 48 hours for them to correct the mistake that they made.Horrible customer service and you can only speak to someone on live chat no tel number. No discount offered or anything for the inconvenience caused. Basically just a tough luck and on your way.

            The shoes they sent were two different sizes. LOL -- like, for real, I'm laughing. I wanted to wear them to a wedding, but I guess I'll have to wear a mangey, 6-year-old pair of flats instead.

            Just bad! my package was to be delivered in a week. Did not come the day they claimed. I was also never given a tracking number and after hours of talking to their horrible custumer service I got one from a shipping company in the UK. People I live in the U.S. for christ sake! Worst part was to find out that the stupid package has not even left the United Kingdom. Now they tell me to wait until August 31st to contact them again. I never wanted to wait 2 week for a pair of white shoes. Im never buying from them ever again. Terrible company.

            I am absolutely disgraced by the ASOS 'customer service' team. I made an order for next day delivery over a week ago.. it still hasn't arrived. Not only that, but asos have taken my money, and have lied to me and have said that their chosen courier, DPD, have delivered my parcel! I don't know what to do, ASOS are completely refusing to co operate with me, saying that my parcels been 'signed for' although no one was in, and the parcel quite clearly isn't here, meaning that a member of DPD staff signed for the parcel themselves. I am absolutely outraged, ASOS have taken a lot of money out of my account and haven't provided me with any form of compensation, apology or refund. They're an absolute con.

            If I could give them 0 stars then I would.Their customer service is absolutely awful. I paid for the 'premier' next day delivery but on three separate occasions they failed to arrive next day. One item didt even show up and the best Asos could do was offer 15% I will never ever use them again. Their live chat representatives are rude, I called them, they were also rude and unhelpful. They never anwser your questions over email. They are by far the worst company I have ever had to deal with. Every other retailer gets it right and if not they always offer some type of refund or solution, not Asos they are awful and I will never use them again.

            If I could give them a negative, I would. When hey had a promo $50 off $200, I ordered $200 worth of stuff and got the discount. However, when the package was delivered, there were 3 items missing. I contacted them the first time, rhey said they would replace those items, but then I waited and waited, nothing happened. I contacted them the second time, one item was sent. The other two items were still missing. So I contacted them again, they refunded me the second item. The third item is still missing. They said that it's because it's out of stock and they can't refund me because it would go below the $200 threshold to be qualified for the discount. The problem is I didn't return anything and it's their fault to not fulfill their job and now they are threatening me that if I keep asking for a refund, they will take off my $49.99 discount. It's ridiculous, I don't understand where the integrity of this company is. They charged me for an item that I'm not receiving, and threatened their customer. Do not do any business with them. They are horrible and worst customer service ever.

            I am extremely unhappy with their service. I have been a good client and until my last experience. During my last order number 278833812, they have expired their limit until when I can receive the goods and now they are asking for an extra 72x hours to have a reply from the correct ""department"".I do think that this is inadmissible to have to wait for 72x hours to have them communicating between 2 of their departments, furthermore I have requested to cancel the order (since they have passed the deadline) and they have still demanded to wait for the 72x hours. I had the opportunity to talk with Paul and Diana and I have clearly explained that I cannot wait 72x hours to have a reply from their side and it is inadmissible but nothing was done and they still remain obliging to wait for 72x hours. This is inadmissible! Nothing can justify this, since one if they have lack of staff, this is their fault and it obviously affects the client experience and second if it takes too long to receive a reply form the transporter, it is also their fault since they are the ones who hire them. I am extremely dissatisfied with this the worst costumer experience that I have received so far, and foremost it is my money that they have and they are making me wait to refund it to me! And to finalize my costumer experience Paul has closed the chat in my face without even confirming if I was done or not. This is an outrageous and I cannot believe that a company like Asos can be compliant with this kind to attentiveness.

            I ordered a pair of shoes on the 1st of August. It is now the 21st and still no shoes (when I tracked them it said they had been delievered to a ""secure location"". What is their definition of a secure location?). Last week I got in contact to say that I hadn't received the delivery, after countless emails back and forth and still no solution, I decided to ring them. Finding a number to ring them on was a task in itself and when I got through I explained what had happend and a lady said they would send another pair out*. I received an email going over the phone call and it said that i should be expecting a Despatched email. I checked my emails today and still no email. I have gone on a live chat to say that I haven't received an email, and said that either I want the shoes immediately or I want a refund as you've had my money for 21 days and no shoes (which I'd now consider stealing). The idea of a refund was completely ignored and I was told that the investigation team had to look into it and were very busy. Well I have news for asos, they are not the only people who are busy! So now I'm expected to wait even longer (than 21 DAYS) for a pair of shoes. A few days ago I ordered items of Urban outfitter and Schuh and they have arrived early today. I received text message and they gave me options for where they would like it to be delievered if no ones in (I.e a neighbour) and I was really impressed. I wonder why a company like asos can't do that too?  I am really disappointed and fustrated. This was my first order with asos and it came so highly recommended and it's been nothing but a nightmare. Reading through the other reviews it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who's experiencing these problems. And it appears that the customer care team are trained to say the same thing, and their is some sort of good cop bad cop situation going on. One person can be very rude and hang up and then another person would say whatever you want to hear. Poor Show ASOS!   *Whilst on the phone call, I asked for a good will gesture and they gave me15% off my next order (which was very hard to get out of them).But obviously that would require me ordering from them again, which now I am not likely to do.Sorry for the long essay*UPDATE* the shoes are now out of stock so they will give me a refund.

I GOT A MESSAGE FROM THE DELIVERY COMPANY SAYING IT WILL BE DELIVERED ON 13.08.2018 BUT NO INFORMATION FROM ASOS AS TO WHY THERE IS A DELAY.  A FEW HOURS LATER, AFTER I'VE SELECTED MY DELIVERY TIME SLOT THEY SENT OUT A STANDARD MESSAGE SAYING THERE IS A DELAY AND OFFERING COMPENSATION TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAID FOR THE DELIVERY EXCLUDING THE PREMIUM CUSTOMERS, SO I SENT AND EMAIL ABOUT THIS BUT NEVER GOT A RESPONSE.  CONTACTED SOMEONE ON THEIR CHAT SERVICE ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON THE DAY OF THE DELIVERY AS THE DELIVERY TIME SLOT HAD PAST AND I STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY ITEMS AND I WAS PROVIDED WITH THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL PERSON NAMED TAYYIBAH WHO WOULD NOT HELP ME AND INSTEAD QUOTED ME THE TERMS OF CONDITION AND THEN ABRUPTLY ENDED THE CHAT TELLING ME SHE CANT HELP ME ANYMORE.  AS IT WAS A SUNDAY I COULD NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE OVER THE PHONE SO I DECIDED TO CALL ON THE MONDAY AND SPOKE TO HANNAH WHO WAS REALLY SWEET AND HELPFUL AND TRIED TO HELP ME WITH THE ISSUE.  SHE TOLD ME A THE END OF OUR CALL THAT SHE WOULD SEND A CONFIRMATION EMAIL BUT I NEVER GOT THIS.  I CHASED THIS UP THROUGH THE FACEBOOK MESSENGER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE BUT NONE OF THEM HELPED.  I JUST WAITED FOR THE DELIVERY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN THE HOPES THAT IT WILL TURN UP BUT AGAIN NOTHING SO THURSDAY MORNING I DECIDED TO CALL DPD THE DELIVERY COMPANY, AND TO MY SURPRISE THE PACKAGE WAS MARKED LOST.  THE GIRL I SPOKE WITH INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS SCANNED INTO THEIR SYSTEM BUT NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS THEN BEEN PUT IN SINCE THEN.  SO IN A VERY INFURIATED STATE I CALLED ASOS SPOKE TO A RUDE GUY NAMED ROSS WHO TOLD ME THERE SYSTEM IS DOWN SO HE CAN'T HELP AND I JUST HAVE TO CALL BACK LATER, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT MADE ME EVEN MORE ANGRY.  HE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST OFFERED TO TAKE DOWN MY NUMBER AND CALLED ME BACK ONCE THEIR SYSTEM ISSUE WAS FIXED BUT INSTEAD HE HUNG UP ON ME.  I CALLED BACK RIGHT AWAY AND SPOKE WITH A GIRL NAMED TAMALA, AND MIRACULOUSLY THERE SYSTEM WAS BACK UP AND SHE COULD NOW HELP.  I EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT THE ISSUE AND SHE TRIED TO HELP AND PROMISED THAT I WOULD GET A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ITEMS THAT I ORDERED THAT IS NOW LOST AND ALSO GET A MANAGER TO CALL ME BACK.  I SAID TO HER THAT I WANT THE MANAGER TO CALL ME BACK IN A FEW HOURS AND THAT SHE WOULD SEND ME A CONFIRMATION EMAIL AND AGAIN LIKE THE LAST TIME I NEVER GOT THE EMAIL  AND THE CALL BACK FROM A MANAGER NEVER HAPPENED.  TO ADD INSULT TO THE INJURY AN ITEM THAT I SENT BACK TO BE REPLACED FOR A DIFFERENT SIZE ON SATURDAY ARRIVED WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE TO TAMALA, SO THIS JUST ADDED FUEL TO THE FLAME.  I DECIDED TO CALLED BACK AFTER NOT HEARING FROM A MANAGER AND SPOKE TO MARY WHO WAS REALLY RUDE AND VERY CONDESCENDING AND REFUSES TO PUT ME THROUGH TO A MANAGER AND SAID THEY HAVE PROCESS AND THAT I'VE TOLD THIS ALREADY SO SHOULD JUST WAIT.  I CALLED THE HEAD OFFICE TO SEE IF I CAN SPEAK TO SOMEONE IN CHARGE OF THE CS TEAM BUT AGAIN NO ONE CAN SPEAK TO ME AND WAS REDIRECTED BY THEIR RECEPTIONIST TO CALL THE CS TEAM.  I CALLED THE CS TEAM YET ANOTHER TIME AND THIS TIME SPOKE WITH ROB WHO WAS VERYS SWEET AND TRIED TO HELP COME TO A RESOLUTION, I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS RESOLVED BUT STILL LEFT ME VERY DISAPPOINTED.  TODAY, I GET MESSAGE FROM A GIRL NAMED TASHA THROUGH THEIR FACEBOOK MESSENGER NOT EVEN VIA EMAIL TO SAY THEY TRIED TO REPLACE THE ITEMS BUT ITS OUT OF STOCK SO THEY ARE JUST GOING TO REFUND ME THE MONEY BUT STILL SEND ME THE ITEM THAT IS OUT OF STOCK,  I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST BEEN GIVEN THE OPTION TO CHOOSE TO GET A DIFFERENT SIZE CONSIDERING IVE MENTIONED ON TWO OCCASIONS THAT I WIL BE WEARING IT FOR LONDON FASHION WEEK BUT NO THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.  I CALLED  TO SEE IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO JUST GET A DIFFERENT SIZE BUT WAS TOLD NO THEY ARE PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE WITH REPLACEMENTS AND THAT THEY CANT DO ANYTHING FOR ME ANYMORE.  I AM STILL VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DEFINITELY QUESTIONS WHETHER I SHOULD REMAIN A CUSTOMER.

            Really disappointed with ASOS and their 'premier' delivery service - countless times I've placed an order for next day delivery and it's been delayed - the most recent order by 48hours when I needed the item for an event. It wouldn't be so bad if their customer service wasn't equally as shambolic - numerous emails sent and PMs on social media - no response and can't find a contact number anywhere to speak to a real person. I love fashion and the brands that ASOS sell but they need to refine their delivery and customer service IMHO. I certainly will not be recommending them and will not be renewing my 'premier' delivery subscription.

            Would avoid. Placed an order with 2 items in it. Parcel arrived but was sent the wrong needle and thread embellished maxi dress. Asking customer support for help was pointless. They offered no help whatsoever, the dress was not replaced with the correct item. Nightmare, worst still I paid over a £100 for the dress and now due to their incompetence I am without a dress for a wedding in 3 days time and also need to wait a fortnight for a refund.I have absolutely no problem with returning the incorrect item but at least I expect to be sent the correct item.

I said I would never order from this company again (silly me) I give in as they had a specific item in stock that I failed to find anywhere else online so I paid for next day delivery and nothing arrived, I spoke on live chat and was told it would be the following day and still nothing, all I get from them is it will be the following day and still nothing has arrived.

            If I could rate lower I would. I ordered two belts, what arrived was one of the belts I'd ordered and a disgusting baby pink visor. So, I fill out the returns form and send the ugly visor back, then get straight onto Twitter to try to resolve the issue and have the second belt I ordered sent to me. I'm met with total radio silence. So, I email and, after days of back and forth, they finally put through a request for a replacement on next day delivery. I log in to my account to see that the ""replacement"" they have requested is for the belt that actually turned up in the first place. I call their customer service team and am told that it's my responsibility to ensure that the second incorrect item is returned too, and that I'll have to wait another 48 hours for the request for the item I asked for in the first place to be processed. It's extremely worrying when their core function as a business is something they are simply not able to do. I was offered a 10% discount code as an apology (that expires in two weeks!!!), but why on earth would I want to give this awful company yet MORE of my money when they've yet to rectify the issue with my outstanding order?! Avoid at all costs!

            I wish I could give a 0. I ordered a bunch of jeans in a waist size 25, they came and measured out to be 23 instead. Bad enough already. And they don't offer exchanges, you have to return the items and reorder them in a different size. Well when I returned them they would not refund me everything that I spent because of a promo code I used. Yes they took $100 from a high school student, lovely company :) And the customer service representative treated me like I was dumb and then ended the chat suddenly with no warning. This really sucks because after all this I don't wanna buy from them ever again but they are one of two stores I know that sells the kinds of jeans I like available in petite sizes, the other being Topshop but theirs are too expensive. So I either have to support a company that scammed me out of $100 or have like 2 pairs of jeans because Topshop's are like $80 and I can't afford so many of those.

            Absolutely disgusting I ordered a parcel for next day delivery didn't come through, then rang up the services they lost my parcel and couldn't give me a refund within 72 hours or couldn't send me out the same items for the next day, so I then had to order the package for next day delivery again which also didn't come through . the first order has come through a day late being told I would get a refund for it being lost but actually it's shown up and then I have been told I can't get a refund now unless I send it back, so I have been made to make a second order yet it wasn't actually needed so I am down money because I have to send one back which I was told was lost . So not only has the phone service given me false knowledge of the packages and delivery they have also caused me too spend money that is inappropriate to spend and they have also given me a terrible service

            I'm previously a very loyal customer to Asos but not anymore!! Awful customer services. I ordered a top which arrived in awful quality with stains on and loose threads, I complained and was told to send the faulty top back and will receive a refund, and they will send me a new top. Received another top which was fine, but a few weeks passed and I didn't get my refund, I messaged them again and they explained I won't be getting one because I received a new top!!

I am being pushed around and still awaiting a refund for an item that I returned to their center and delivered on 7/28/17. Today is 8/11/17 and nothing. I contacted them on 8/8/17 and got the run around to wait a until 8/10/17. Contacted them today 8/11/17 and was told they will have to do a 48hrs investigation and they will get back to me. This is 2017; what kind of crap is this? You received my item and obviously someone messed up on your end and I the paying customer who's been waiting 14 days already have to continue to wait while you investigate? If an ASOS rep is reading, PLEASE NOTE THAT I WANT MY MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY (Order# 275567313). This isn't how customer service is done. Once proof is provided, the customer should be refunded while you investigate period!!!!!!!!! I AM EXTREMELY AGGRAVATED!!!

I have contacted asos today to resolve this and they have said they can do nothing about it and i will have to wait for it to be redelivered tomorrow. i Specifically ordered next day delivery because it was a gift for a party i am going to this evening. Even after explaining this, i was told ''wait for delivery tomorrow, thats all i can do''.This is utterly disgusting customer service, especially as I am a very active customer through Asos. I wasn't even offered a refund on the delivery charge!!!i now have to go out of my way and buy another gift just so i dont look bad, and still have to hand over the original gift because that is what they asked for.because of your error, i am going to be out of pocket, yet there is nothing you can do about it? this is disgusting.Will never use you again unless i get a response to my liking!

            I order from ASOS VERY frequently as I really like the brands they stock. However I have had multiple bad experiences with their customer services, the people they employ to be on the other end of the phone/ chat with us feature are extremely rude and do not seem to care you are a paying customer. The women I had recently was trying to make multiple excuses for them not delivering next day delivery, I wasn't offered a refund for the next day delivery she basically just told me to order it again if I needed it urgently, (i ordered it the Friday, complained on the Tuesday as I had to go away on the thursday) and so i ended up paying twice whilst i waited for a refund.Basically the website is fine until something goes wrong in any sort of way with your order and then they will do very little to resolve your problem.

            ASOS have a habit of putting PROMO codes on their site and taking them away without notice BEFORE the expiry date of the promotion, hence making us miss out on the savings we could make.  In my case, the promo was to expire at 11:59pm AEST on Tuesday 8 August 2017.  So I put the $322 coat in my basket with the intention of buying it today - 7 August - with my $70 discount promo code.  Surprise surprise the code has now been taken off the site more than 24 hours before the published end date - so no discount for me.  When I asked ""customer service"" I was told they would not honour the code unless I had a screen shot of the small print.  And again, surprise surprise, I can't get a screen shot of the small print because they have removed it from their site!!!  What a crock - that's all I can say.  Sometimes you can get too big and lose sight of the small things.  Asos NOT COOL.

            Honestly I read reviews about this website and a lot of them were really bad but I saw a couple claiming positive stuff like ""I loved the things I got"" and there was one comment that convinced me to just try it, it's was ""idk why there are so many bad reviews it's probably just competitors trying to bad mouth this website.."" TRUST ME IT IS NOT. I've tried tons of online shopping sites and this one is by far the worst! Yeah sure I got my stuff but let me tell you 1. It was pretty horrid quality... all of the tags say ""made in Pakistan or Egypt.... 2. All the fabric is cotton so if you wash it and wanna dry it ... IT WILL SHRINK! And 3 the thing that drove me ******* insane was the fact that I agreed on paying $108 for everything... I got charged $176 on my bank statement!!!!! AND ON TOP OF THAT had to pay an extra $50 on customs and delivery when my order came to the door. Asos claims it is free world wide shipping but don't trust it. I ended up paying a giant total of $226 for 6 articles of clothing... I'm so upset especially since I only agreed on spending $108 :( Do yourself a favour and forget you saw this website. Trust me you can find a WAY better one. You already know I won't be shopping here again. Oh and if I could rate this thing with a negative I totally would but apparently they don't give you that option.

            Hi, My first experience with ASOS has been extremely disappointing. I placed an order on Sunday which was meant to reach me yesterday, however the tracking information showed that the order had not been received by Royal Mail. I contacted ASOS who assured me it would still be delivered and so I waited in all day and it didn't arrive. I then found an email in my junk inbox notifying me of a return I had made and that all the items would be refunded. I then was told I would have to re-order the whole order and pay again so I would be out of pocket until my refund comes through. Luckily only one of the items I ordered was out of stock however it is disappointing that an order that was clearly not a return was processed as a return and put back into the system for someone else to purchase. The customer service I have received has been very disappointing from a company I had expected more from. I have now had to re-purchase the items that are still in stock whilst waiting for a refund on an order that I never received so I am out of pocket, but have no choice as if I wait the items will be out of stock.

            I love ASOS! They are a great company, the customer services team always help me whenever I've had issues. Also, the delivery options are great too. The premier option is fab as you only pay £9 for next day delivery all year which is an undeniable bargain for someone like me who's always online shopping. They stock so many brand which is great as you can buy from loads of shops in one place. My only issue with them would be that sometimes the quality of the products can be a little questionable in terms of the materials used/garment construction but nothing that would stop me from buying.

            My brother in law and I ordered 2 items for my partner on the 6July for her birthday the 13July. So, we did the express shipping for the items to reach within 5 business days. So the parcel had to arrive on the 13July as a birthday surprise. Paid about 200NZD for the 2 items and express shipping included. We ended up getting the items on the friday. At least I was able to get her a cake for the day. It sucked I could not surprise her with the items because it was her first birthday we celebrated as a couple. All I want to know is, why did we pay for express shipping? If the items came at standard shipping days. Thanks for ruining the day thumbs up.

            Sent a return back 8 days ago.. and they say they have yet to receive it.. apparently 14 working days plus 4 as they are busy., so that'll be almost a month for a refund .. quick enough to take it out of my bank account when I bought the item.. very poor serviceUpdate.. after this review and a letter of complaint to a manager I got an email to say my refund was being processed and in my account in 3 days.. it does pay to complain and keep them on their toes ..

            Just ordered a top for my daughter, size 8, she then informs it needs to be a 10. Thought I would go on the site and request change to size as only ordered 1 hr ago. For standard delivery you are given 60 mins to cancel, I tried to cancel after 65 mins. I then got onto their web chat help to see if they could put through the amend, they advised there was nothing they could do to intercept the order and I would have to return the item and stand the postage. All this for 5 mins over the time, its not as though I even wanted to cancel the order, just change size before the order was posted. I asked to put through to their Complaints team, was advised they didn't have a Complaints team, how can any organisation of reasonable size not have a complaints team, that smacks of real arrogance , inflexibility and contempt for their customers. really not impressed, won't be returning.

            Ordered swimsuits for an upcoming trip last Monday. They said it would be delivered Friday at the latest. I sent customer service an email (no response). Then I tweeted @ASOS_HeretoHelp on Thursday letting them know that UPS's tracking website said that the shipment label had been created but that it hadn't been shipped to them yet. ASOS DM'd me back and said that the shipping label was probably damaged and that it should arrive on time. Messaged them again Friday letting them know that my package hadn't arrived. They messaged me back to tell me that they passed this onto their ""delivery investigation team"" to look into and that I would receive an update in 48 hours. 48 hours response time is ridiculous. Didn't hear from the ""delivery investigation team"" over 48 hours later so DM'd them again at 4 pm to which they ignored my messages/tweets (as I see them responding to other people on twitter). They finally message me at 12 am ""You've now been refunded 113.00 USD to your MasterCard today the 31st July for your order as the items are now out of stock. The funds can take 5-10 working days to appear in your account so you'll receive it by the 14th of August at the latest. If there are any other questions just let us know and we'll be happy to help."" No apology, or anything. After reading the reviews I'm nervous about the package I returned hopefully I'll get a refund for that. With such a big business, how do they not have a customer service phone number? I've emailed the ""customer service email"" multiple times in the past with no response.

            I have been shopping with ASOS since I was a teenager around 16-17 and I have always had great service. But they have been up and coming and clearly become more reputable business so the customer service has significantly decreased to a point I am considering boycotting their website. I ordered from ASOS and both parcels were not delivered on time. One was delivered to a neighbour without my consent and the parcel was open and a £10 pair of sandals were taken. When I went back to complain to asos, this billion pound company, they claim it is a dispute between me and my neighbour. Its just disgusting to think that a company cannot use any discretion whatsoever, they'd rather have a customer ruin their reputation online than actually resolve disputes, its a shame.

            Asos used to be excellent and I had been a customer for years, having spent thousands of pounds. But recently they have changed. They have sent me faulty items, or refunded the wrong item. Recently they claim never to have received the returned items I have sent them and have refused to refund. Unfortunately I have misplaced the post office receipt and they say that until the parcel reaches them it is ""my responsibility"". This is not mentioned in their return policy, and it does not say anywhere that they are exempted from refunding in the case of item being lost in the post. I am disappointed as the fact that I have been a loyal customer for years has not been considered at all! It is hurtful to be accused of lying. I will not be returning as a customer. Be aware !

            Love love love! Delivery was very fast, opted for standard shipping and parcels got here in 4 business days. All dresses were just as pictured and fit perfectly. I'm 5 ft 2 in and weight 122 lbs and ordered US size 6. Note: reg midi dresses will be like a maxi dress on petites. Nice quality a bit on the pricier side, but  everything was 50% off when they ran a promo for July 4th, 2017. Overall very happy with purchase and can't wait to purchase again when they run more promotions.

            I had no idea ASOS was a UK company.  When I searched up a dress their website came up. The prices were in Canadian dollars and shipping was free (I therefore assumed it was Canadian).  I know there was mention that duty may apply (somewhere in their terms & conditions) but I dismissed this, thinking I wasn't shopping internationally.  I understand duty fees vary from one country to the next, so the amount cannot be calculated at the time of checkout. However, when duty charges do apply to certain countries there should be a ""plus duty fees will apply"" statement on the checkout. I thought I was getting a great deal, and now I'm having to pay $73 in duty fees.   Customer service was of no use. I'm pretty much stuck because I paid a shipping fee to have it expedited, and will now have to pay to have it shipped back.   They really need to put prices in pounds initially, and then allow customers to change it to their currency.  My first & last time shopping with ASOS.

            I returned an item to ASOS on 11 July 2017, based on the fact it was discoloured and of absolutely terrible quality. It in no way resembled the product portrayed on their website. It is now 25 July and I am still waiting on my refund to be processed. On contacting customer service, I was informed that if I did not receive a refund by 21 July, I should contact them with postage information and they will process my refund. I did exactly that, and was informed by a rude and condescending customer representative (Alena) that I should wait another couple of days for the refund to be processed. After doing exactly this, I followed up with several other customer service reps, who have asked me to wait and wait for the refund to be processed. I really question whether I will ever receive my refund, and believe that the customer service reps will just continue to defer my enquiry. I online shop all the time, but this is by far the worst customer service I have ever received. I would seriously discourage anyone from ordering from ASOS in the future - I know they have a wide range of products, but it's just not worth the hassle if something doesn't match its appearance on the website. Their customer service staff are condescending, and simply ignore queries rather than taking meaningful action. They have no respect for the time of their customers.

Sent a reminder after that and they replied that they will get back to me in 2 days and they they will ship out the item asap and keep me updated.No news for another week and I had to write to them again. This time, they tell me that the item is out of stock and they will refund me only after I shipped back the wrong T shirt back to them.

            I made a online purchase to ASOS and I received it earlier than I had expected, which was a bonus! I had purchased the TALL Scoop Front Swimsuit Multipack-Black/White (size 8 US). I am 5'11'' and it is already hard to find bathing suits for my height so once I received the black bathing suit it fit perfectly and I am extremely happy with it! Even though the two bathing suits are the same size the white one had a little bit more excess fabric along the sides which made it not as fitting in the waist as the black one. Other than that very happy with this site and will be ordering more items in the future!

            Sent an item back via Royal Mail 15 days ago, even though tracking says it has arrived and I have sent numerous messages with proof of postage etc - ASOS Customer Care still haven't issued my refund, because their apparently super busy and overworked! ASOS Customer Service had really deteriorated! Their staff send generic impersonal responses to messages/queries and you won't actually get any useful response from them. They also now have made it only possible to contact their Customer Service via one channel - Twitter! Therefore set up an account with Twitter prior to ordering anything from ASOS, as the likelihood is that at some point you will need to contact them. However don't expect a useful speedy response and they can't seem to cope with the number of messages they receive. Therefore it is easier for them to just copy and paste the same response to several people.It is such a shame that a brand that was so forward thinking and revolutionary in the online shopping experience 12 years got greedy and expanded too much and no longer have the manpower and resources to enable a smooth and outstanding shopping experience.

It is Sunday now and no explanation has been offered and I am being told to just wait until Monday to see if it arrives but if not I can contact ASOS again?! ASOS still cannot promise when this will arrive, they haven't advised why this has been delayed and they haven't offered even a refund on the next day delivery premium I paid. They have offered 10% off my next order provided it's full price items only and there is also a deadline of a month - clearly not something I'll be using given my current order isn't even here yet.

            I ordered a Women's sneaker and they sent me the same item in the men's version instead. After sending NUMEROUS emails that this was sent in the men's size and not the women's the customer service still did not understand the issue!!! They kept saying if you don't like the item send it back for refund when clearly all I asked was for the women's size and version of the shoe to be sent!!! Because I actually did order the women's version of the shoe so why wasn't it sent properly to me?? Yet the staff still didn't understand and I am sitting here completely frustrated at how horrible this customer service is and probably won't ever receive my shoe. Best part is I can't even call them since I am in the US and their number won't work on my phone. I am very disappointed with the customer service to say the least

            I returned items for a refund and ASOS will not refund the postage.  Its not their ""Policy"". I have requested  at least 5 times by email that the matter to be brought to a managers attention.  I am still waiting.  I get replies from badly trained (if at all) customer service operatives.  Clearly, as a customer, ASOS don't think I am worth it. Spend your money with a company that cares just a fraction more than ASOS.

            Only if we were able to give NO stars! I let one of my siblings charge my debit card to purchase clothes. She processed the order, confirmed it and everything then realized she didn't want the order so she canceled it (idiot). The payment was taken from my checkings, I've been waiting to receive a refund payment from ASOS, this is the 10th day, haven't received anything. I called my bank because they said my bank is withholding the money, not them. In my payment history, the ASOS purchase was no where to be found.

            Worst customer service ever. I ask for a return label and tell them repeatedly I cant print, they keep telling me the same information thats already on the website instead of just telling me they wont help me and that I have to figure out myself how to get it printed as they simply wont help me get it.... wow. other shops just include a freaking return label for free in the order and they force people to print it themselves and if they have no printer then the hassle is for them. such great service, wow. and especially love the way they treat you like a person of questionable intelligence. this surely puts me off to ever order there again. besides, I had to send back pretty much everything as the stuff just isnt as good as it seems.. I just hope Ill get my money back without too much trouble and having to get paypal on their back.... *sigh*Only good thing I experienced is that the website holds a good part of info to make it easy to order and also it arrived very fast... but its so dissapointing to be treated this way...

            ASOS is so easy to order from! It's the only online clothing shop I feel confident using. Swift delivery, always on time. I always receive the correct items in great condition, and when I return items I receive the correct refunds. Everything is confirmed by email which helps to keep track. I haven't needed to contact customer service that often, but when I have they have been very helpfulThe A-list rewards are a great touch and make you feel like you are a valued customerKeep up the good work ASOS!

They said it may take up to 21 + 3 days to get my money back!No item that I ordered, no compensation, no replacement and up to 1 month waiting for my money back!!!!After my complaint they gave me 20% discount on any full price item, at the time where 20% is off as a sale on most items.Feeling a special treatment hah!NEVER AGAIN!

            Ordered something on April 30th, it said it would be delivered by May 11th. Well it was never delivered. I've contacted Asos several times and have talked to numerous customer service agents. They all say they want to help me but then they stop replying to my emails. All I want is a refund. I've now taken to twitter to see if that helps. I've had so many issues with Asos, that this will be the last time I order from them. It's pretty sad because they have nice clothing. I see on this site that other people are having the same issue as me -_-

            I bought 5 dresses - meant to use them for a wedding ceremoni - so many bad things happened:1) one dress were missing2) did almost not get the replacement on time3) ended up returning all items as it did not fit all of us4) only get refund for 4 dresses5) have a heck of a long correspondent with the customer service. After a while they agree that only four items have been processed, but now, as a new customer service girl (again) takes over, she states that all 5 are refunded. That's just not the case.6) seems like she also closed the file, I am not getting any further reply...Asos is truly a big mess when it comes to solving problems THEY happen to make.

            A classic case of false advertising. I ordered a formal dress from this website, and I ordered it in three different sizes, as the sizing chart on Asos is unreliable. When it arrived I instantly noticed the feeling of cheap material, which I was willing to overlook if the dress fitted nicely. It was only when I put it on that I noticed how bad the seams of the dress were, as they were all fraying, and that they had all been somewhat crooked. The zippers on all three dresses were cheap and keep getting stuck on nothing.Overall, it was a complete waste of money, and I will be returning the dresses. I would not recommend this website to anyone.

            UPDATE: After a lot of grief the manager sent me an apology and a 20% voucher. I have ordered from ASOS since 2008 so it's only fair I update the rating to a 3. Usually great service but when there are issues they really need to resolve them much quicker than in this case. Customers don't want to spend this amount of time chasing one refund and going through needless weeks of email correspondence - especially when this issue could have been resolved in 5 minutes by competent customer service representatives. Previous 1 star rating review: Bought two pairs of jeans from ASOS. Kept less expensive pair and other pair were too big so sent back. They refunded wrong jeans, owe me £44 which they repeatedly acknowledge via approximately 14 emails to date. They continually give me dates to wait until ""as the refund will take 5 - 10 days"" and two months later there is no sign of a refund. Now they do not even answer my emails. Definitely the worst customer service of all time. Will never place an order with them again.Monday 10th July - Am now being told that I have to prove that I didn't receive my £44 refund. They need all my bank statements since the transaction showing all my transactions to prove that I didn't receive the refund. No suggestion of them actually checking why the refund did not go through their end. Have to provide confidential account information to ASOS to prove that a refund didn't come through. Sounds simple enough but given that the information changes depending on who answers the email every day, this is far from the end of this issue. I am going to update this every day so you can all see how much of a disaster their customer ""service"" is..

            Asos has completely gone down hill, it seems the bigger they have become the less they feel they should deliver a good service and not to mention well manufactured clothing. They clearly don't carry out quality control as a sweatshirt I recently ordered had two different sized cuffs!I wish I could include pictures on here as it really does show how shockingly different they are.AVOID using Asos, there's far better out there and far better places to spend you money on and get what you actually should be getting - well made clothes with a great customer service to go with it!

            Careless, sloppy organisation and the prices are not even particularly competitive. In my experience they send the wrong item as often as they send the correct one. My last order from them included an item I hadn't ordered, a cheap looking necklace. I suppose I should have kept quiet and thrown it away. When I asked them how to send it back they told me I had to parcel it up and take it to the post office.  My son ordered a jacket, at a price of over £190, and they sent him a pair of cheap trousers by mistake. They then said the item he ordered was no longer in stock but they wouldn't refund his money until he had returned the cheap trousers that they had sent by mistake.   I won't order from them again. They should be sued more often.

            If I could give no stars I would. Ordered a dress for my daughters prom, delivery was great arrived next day like I had payed for, opened the parcel all excited to see what it was going to look like for my daughter only to find it was completely the wrong dress, wrong colour, size and nothing like I had ordered. Emailed, messengered and tried to call to resolve the matter quickly. Had no response for ages. Finally got an email back apologising and saying that they would send me the correct dress out and  refund the postage costs (great I thought it will be sorted) this was on the Friday.  Monday came and I had not been updated in the correct dress being sent out so I emailed again (at this time the dress was still in stock) by Tuesday no response so I emailed again. I then checked online to make sure the dress was still in shock and surprise surprise they had completely sold out. I finally got an email back after again emailing my concerns. They told me that that morning they had gone to pack the dress and realised it was out of stock even though they had told me they had sorted the correct dress on the Friday to be delivered to me. Now I have no dress and no money to order a new one as they are telling me it can take 10 days before they can confirm the returned dress is back and 5 more days for the money to be refunded, that's 15 days, my daughters prom is in 10 days and I do not have more funds for a second dress, iv told them this but they do not care. I have sent proof of postage and that should be enough for them to issue my refund. I have been emailing back and fourth and never have the same person reply and they all say different things, they are in competent and unprofessional and I have never experienced such an awful customer service.  Asos was once a great company but has seriously gone down hill. I will never use them again. I don't usualy post reviews but I felt I needed to warn others. I'm now stuck and have no idea what to do. All they keep saying is  order a second dress, I tried to explain to them that not everyone has an endless pot of money. I had to save for my daughters prom dress and she was so excited,now she is heartbroken and I feel helpless. I would suggest staying well clear if you don't want the stress and the agrow from this company, they are a complete joke.

            One of worst companies currently still allowed the trade. Also they delivery partner DPD are as bad as ASOS.NEVER in the future would I use of recommend ASOS.They don't not really do ""time delivery, express or NEXT day Delivery"" even if you purchase the yearly one off "" PremiumDeliveryService for £10"" even than DPD will let you down and ASOS won't do anything about it.They don't have a call centre. (big company like them and don't have it, some what trading standards should review)So basically, I've ordered my items with next day delivery.To be told by DPD, ASOS didn't send us the items in time for next day delivery. so it won't be delivery as promised by ASOS.Then i was told yes it will be delivered but the driver hasn't scanned the items today. then later on was told don't call us it will be delivered.Still wasn't so ended up spending over £100 shopping in london last minutes to ensure i have my items for my sisters wedding. Then the next day was told for sure it will be sent today and LIAM (works behalf of CEO of DPD) so as it was the wedding day i selected please deliver to 136 and we will be out. only then to be sent a messaged items signed and delivered to 142. 142 no one by the name of kev lives there and they haven't received the item. funny thing they were all at work during the time of delivery. DPD said for you us to investigation you are not my Customer please pick up with ASOS. Rang ASOs but they don't have call centre to messaged on twitter and FACebook only to be told please send us your details when they have received over 20 emails from me. then ASOs said they can't refund in time can't reimburse me and will speak to DPD about items however i;ve sent them all the emails from DPD.Both companies and FUKING dogs.

I sent a mail to customer care, the same they respond, and without any proof and questions, they immideitly sent the other pair too and they apologized. they were sooo quick to correct their mistakes. Btw their delivery is soooo quick. In delivery settings, it is always shown that goods will be arrived in almost 2 weeks (exluding weekends). Howevery, they always arrive in 6 days.

            ASOS used to be really good years ago.  Where they should be faster and should have improved, they have gone in the complete opposite direction. They used to offer 10% off whenever your order was wrong be or late, now they just say it's been delayed you should wait, or simply tell you to return the incorrect item. Getting a response from them is another thing. You need to send several messages and get their attention in a social media post to get them to respond.  Emails you'll be waiting days too. They just don't care about their customer service anymore. Even when you do get a response, you often go around in circles and repeat yourself.  I returned an order on the 23 June which showed they received it back on the 26th June, and after being told all sorts of stuff as to why they won't check why my return wasn't processed yet including that they haven't received it (when I showed them proof of delivery), I was told to wait till the 7th July for them to be able to look into it.  Waiting almost 2 weeks after they have received your return to investigate why you haven't been refunded is unacceptable, and that's within the UK.  I can't imagine how long international returns take.  Sadly ASOS has become somewhere to order with caution - if something goes wrong or doesn't fit and you need to return, you've got a big headache coming.

            Wish I could give less! My delivery was given an hour long slot, I stayed back half an hour from work only for it to not arrive. I then went online to find a contact number for ASOS to check where my delivery was as my office has closed and there was no way for them to deliver it. There was no such number. I went through all the information online about what to do if your delivery didn't arrive, as my office is closed on a Saturday I opted for the delivery to be rerouted to a local shop for collecting the next day and was informed that I'd get a text to tell me what time it was ready to collect at 12pm and the next day. All seemed pretty simple. By 3pm the next day still nothing so I sent an email through the account section on the website, didn't hear back. By this point I'm getting really frustrated, not only have I wasted time by staying back at work but now my Saturday is being taken up chasing them for a response, I needed the delivery for my holiday and only had limited time.  So I found them on Facebook and saw that their messages are replied to instantly, great I thought, no reply hours later. So I posted directly on their page and commented on their posts asking for a reply, I then saw loads of other people with the same issue. Funnily enough when there was something in the public domain I got a reply! Basically telling me to wait until 10pm as that's when they deliver up until, this is a joke right? The shop is shut, it's impossible to deliver it now plus where is my explanation as to why it wasn't delivered in the first place? Then comes the waiting for the next response, when the waiting gets too much I then have to post on their page again before I get any response. Basically I'm getting nowhere so I ask for a phone call, I'm then told I've been put in a que, still no phone call by 10.30pm. I'm also having another conversation with them on email, these guys are telling me in might not be delivered until Monday and the social media crew are saying Sunday! They are absolutely clueless, their answers are generic and there's no solutions or explanations being offered. ASOS retrain all of your staff and get a call centre so you can actually manage your complaints, looks like you get enough of them!

            I thought i liked asos untill all the products i recieved were not well made and overpriced. BEWARE!!!!! I returned a pair of jeans and they did not refund me the $70. I got in contact with them and they said they would not refund me because i used a promo code but I only spent so much money because of the promo code. They would also not send the product back to me. AKA they stole from me DO NOT buy from this site.

            Bought my prom dress from here and the dress arrived on time and was beautiful. Upon turning around, there was a huge rip in the lace on the back of the dress, which looked as though the fabric had been singed off as there's no fabric in the middle of the hole to even allow the ability to sew it back together. It's unfathomable how this passed quality control as it is blatantly obvious there is a huge fault with the dress. Also, returns and a new shipment take 7 days which means (if on time) the dress will arrive on prom day which isn't a chance I want to take so I'm going to have to source elsewhere at a higher price. Huge inconvenience and would've been a 5* rating if the dress wasn't defective.

From sending incorrect items on a regular basis to not delivering nextday orders, its very frustrating and disappointing as most orders are gifts for others.Asos no longer appreciates premier Account holders. No loyalty to long term, regular customers. Constantly disappointed!!! Asos has lost a loyal customer.

Refunds arent made despite proof of postage and evidence of receipt of items at their warehouse. Clothing items are sent out damaged or so creased they are totally unwearable.

            I purchased numerous (upwards of 20) pieces from asos. Due to size/ fit, I had to return many items. Simple enough to return the item, but forget getting a refund. I returned 4 packages but was refunded for only 3. It's impossible to get a customer service rep to respond, and when they do, they expect you to do the work (I sent back all order/payment confirmations + my postal receipt + their acknowledgment of receipt of 4 the packages. Not worth it. I lost a few hundred dollars with no apparent recourse.

            Ordered a swimsuit bottom but instead was sent a top in the same print but a random size. Having a very top heavy body at 34ff this was the worst possible scenario for me. To make matters worse asos was the only place claiming to have the matching bottom when clearly they did not so now I have 2 tops (one that fits from amazon and one that does not from asos) I tried to login to my account to rectify the situation and asos has now locked me out of it saying I have an incorrect password when I know that is not the case. They do not have a phone number to contact them so there is literally no way to fix my order because without logging in I have no order number. I will NEVER be ordering from them again. Thank god I only paid 14 for the bottom. Beware!!  Do not give them your money.

            I had some issues with a refund that was seemingly lost in the Hermes network, and I got a speedy reply to my initial email explaining the delay. When nothing happened for another couple of weeks, I got in contact again, and was refunded despite the missing package.If anything, customer support could be a little quicker but that's not a huge concern for me. My only advice is that I would warn anyone returning an order to Asos not to use the Hermes free collection service and to try the Doddle drop off or other service instead.Overall helpful and very accommodating of my repeated emails due to forgotten details. Thanks a lot!

            If I could leave less than  one star I would. Returned an item on the 9th, tracking shows them receiving it on the 12th. Countless appeals to them about why I haven't got a refund, only to be told they are busy, pass it on to returns team, will hear back at some point, and that they haven't received it yet. The tracking proves otherwise. Never had such a frustrating problem with a shop in my life. No customer service, they don't really provide answers and when you push them to get an answer they don't respond. No phone number to contact on, only social media and email, they tend to ignore most of what you ask. You get an initial response to send over details to help but then no further help and no answers. Frustrated and angry doesn't cover it. Would not use again. It doesn't matter whether or not you are busy, you can't treat customers the way you are doing.

            I'm very disappointed with my experience ordering clothes on Asos.comSometimes I waited more than a week for my order and sometimes only a few days.But once the order arrived it was always a big disappointment. I've had clothes that looked nothing like the picture on the website, things that were actually broken, etc. What most annoyed me recently was how wildly the sizes vary on this particular website. I know that when I have a size S at H&M, I will not have the same size at Zara but the sizes at asos are ridiculous. I ordered a bikini from the bigger bust collection thing and it wouldn't have fit someone that has size 70A! It looked like it was meant for children. Of course I sent my order back and now I've been waiting forever for them to send my money back. I would recommend ordering on asos only if you have already seen the product in real life and know what size you need. Also, if you are a student with not a lot of money like me, don't pay via paypal!! You will wait for your money forever and you will have to live on pizza for the rest of the month!

            Attention: DON’T ORDER TO SWITZERLANDA few weeks ago I ordered some dresses for an upcoming wedding to Switerland, however, I could not keep any of them. On its Website Asos announces that they include already customs costs in their deliveries but nevertheless I got an invoice of the swiss customs for my asos order. I contacted the client service but the contact via email was terribly slow due to “too many requests at the same time”. Lastly, I ended up using the Live Chat on the website and I chattet with Jaqueline from the staff. I forwarded all the official customs documents to her and after contacting the “specialist department” she assured me of the cost absorption on my credit card.Now I am getting a new email from the asos service – again after reconfirmation with the “specialist department” – that they cannot do anything more for me and they redecided to not take over the costs from the invoice anymore. After few more requests from my side with reference to the chat pointed me to the custom office and that was it for them.It´s quite sad that an upcoming company established in ONLINE commerce is apparently not able to ship their goods and to help their customs. I personally find the reaction from asos upon my request uncooperative and brash, since they explicitly announce on their internet page that customs fees are already included (which is obviously not the case) and secondly a employee from asos assured the refund of costs to me already. I feel betrayed and I am stuck on a customs bill.

            Waste of time. I spent hours looking for dresses for a wedding I have in 2 weeks. I waited until my size was available and when it finally was I bought it and everything was fine. Then I receive an email that I didnt pass a 'security check' (even though the payment went through just fine) and they needed my ID and proof of address. I was at work and I was able to give that to them within 10 minutes! I passed the stupid check but it wasn't enough.They cancelled my order and said I'd have to do it again. Now the dresses I wanted are no longer available.They 'took my money' and it'll take 10 business days to get back to my account.Basically, I'm f*cked. Now I have no money, no dresses and no time to fix it before the wedding. Plus, their customer service is horrible! It's the same as talking to a robot. They don't answer any of your questions and just 'hope you appreciate'. A joke and a waste of time.DONT BUY HERE!

            Oh where do I start…I was a first-time shopper with ASOS and I have to say that I will NEVER shop with them again.The order and delivery time was quite an easy process. When the order arrived, I was very disappointed with the quality and poor fit of the clothes so I sent 4 of the 7 items back.The order arrived in the warehouse just 1 day after I had sent it. I contacted customer service 2 weeks after this date to inquire when my money would be refunded. They said that they had not received the order back…. After showing them that they did, it took 2 days for them to send a confirmation email.To my dismay, the discount that was applied to the items of clothes that I had kept was transferred onto the ones that were sent back. Consequently, affecting the amount that will be returned to me! Also, they claim that it can take 21 working days to refund your money. Why on earth does it take that long???Considering the excellent service at Zalando and other online stores… I will never ever shop with ASOS again. Buyer BEWARE!!!!!

            ASOS is a sham!I have been ordering from ASOS for a couple of years now and how much I regret that ! I placed an order with ASOS and received an email notification from their delivery partner saying that the order has been delivered and signed for by the customer when no such thing happened . I contacted the really hard to get customer care team via a chat and was told that they would check and get back to me . Now that didn't happen. Instead what happened was that I was conveniently blocked from contacting them again via chat! I tried their customer care helpline numbers multiple times through the day with no response. I finally got through to their head office and the girl at the other end told me that she would put me through to a customer care executive after I told her all that I've been through with this bitter experience . Guess what she does ? Hangs on me ! Ha ! I called again and obviously she picked it up and put it back down ,again ! You know now it's really not about the money or a stupid dress , it's about exposing this sham! It makes for a wonderful feature  story and I think anyone who values themselves and others should be aware of this and revolt against this bunch of online retail mafia out there trying to rob you of your money . A horrible brand and really deserving of a brutal public boycott of their products! They make money by charging people for orders they don't deliver and then go MIA while you sink into anonymity !

There is no phone number to call and I have no faith that they will ""find"" my order.

            Hi all, just so you are aware... I ordered a big load of clothes from Asos in May and as I spent over a certain amount I got a £30 discount. Delivery came and 2 pairs of the jeans didn't fit but I really wanted one pair and needed them for a special occasion so rather than sending them back and risking them not getting sent back to me on time I just bought them again with next day delivery. I then sent back the two pairs of jeans which didn't fit from my original order and asked for a refund to find that they only wanted to refund me £35 which was the cost of one of the pairs of jeans (the ones which I had reordered a couple of days later to get in the right size) but the other pair which were £30 (the discount which I originally got) was not going to be refunded because they said I was now under the spend limit to receive the discount! I sent them an email and said that it's ridiculous as I have reordered the jeans and spent the money at the store again AND had to pay extra for next day delivery which was something stupid like and extra £5! They then emailed back and said no this is how we work with the ""terms and conditions"". Bear in mind they can see on my account I have spent thousands at Asos over the years you'd think they wouldn't treat a loyal customer like this. Anyway so I emailed back and said try and understand... if I sent back both pairs of jeans... and said I want one refunded and one replaced in a different size...I would have had £35 refunded and still have the other pair of jeans! But at the moment you have £30 of my money/ my pair of jeans which you are technically stealing!? So I have now asked them to send me back the other pair of jeans in a different size if they won't refund me but I haven't had a response yet... let's hope someone with half a brain replies! Just to warn you all, I won't be shopping at Asos again that's for sure!

            I ordered a swimsuit from ASOS. They used Hermes delivery company. Hermes never attempted to deliver (I was in my apartment during all three of their delivery ""attempts,"" and no one ever attempted to contact me). When I contacted ASOS, they merely rehashed that Hermes would only attempt three deliveries. They offered for me to order it again, but the price of the item has increased. The customer service was abysmal.

            The product is fine, the customer service and their communication is HORRIBLE.  I will NEVER shop here again!!!  My first experience was HORRIFIC and I tried to communicate with them via chat and email as they do not have a US phone number.  Even after getting NOTHING resolved, I thought I'd give them a 2nd try.  JUST AS HORRIBLE as the first time.  Don't waste your time or money with this company.  The shorts I ordered arrived missing 2 buttons and my attempts at rectifying this were futile.  I ended up replacing the buttons myself, as I really liked the shorts, and was offered NO compensation

Customer service took longer then i expected but i understand as they are busy.

            I've been shopping with ASOS since 2010, and I've never been compelled to leave a bad review, but I am  deeply disappointed with their idea of customer service. Why bother allowing people submit an inquiry if you never follow up? I was told by two different reps that they would look into the status of my missing order, and never heard back. Had they at least bothered to follow up, I would not be leaving a negative review. I'm now out well over a hundred dollars, and while it's not a huge loss, I'm still incredibly annoyed. I am by no means a fussy customer. I have received incorrect orders in the past, and have had orders cancelled when an item was out of stock, and have never been as irritated as I am by the sheer lack of customer service. I will not be purchasing from ASOS going forward. Many of their items can be bought elsewhere and sometimes for less, so why bother with a company that doesn't value its customers.

They had this offer 20% to everything for one day and I thought how lucky I am so I purchased a travel bag as a gift for my partner s birthday. 5 days later (!!!!!!) they sent me an email informing me that the product that I paid was out of stock and not only that but they said the will refund my money after 10 days!!!! So I paid, obviously I lost my discount and they ruined my surprise for his birthday!!!! Very very poor service very dissatisfied and at least they could offer me a fast delivery with a similar product and the discount instead of telling me look at our website and buy sth else!

            OMG.. Where do I start. So I placed an order and typed in a code for £30 off my order of 3 items!Then my items came and the skirt was too big, so I returned it asking for a different size. Got an email saying I have been refunded the £2 difference. Thinking my skirt was on its way. Waited two weeks then called up and guess what.. My skirt Isn't arriving as they have taken the skirt back in place of giving me £30 off my original order and refunded me the £2 difference. Serious how is this even possible! So asos draw in customers with money off codes/offers but then take it back off us just as quick if the opportunity is there to do so.I didn't want a refund! I wanted an exchange so I'm honouring my side of the terms and conditions set by asos when taking out the offer. I can't believe this is allowed to happen.Disgusting Will never order from Asos again

            Have placed many orders with ASOS and have had mixed opinions on items received. Tend to find the quality of some of the brands isn't very good,  but others are fine. They are, however,  an easy company to deal with returns and find that money is refunded pretty quick.  They also have a large selection of Tall range clothing, although most of which is a bit 'unique ' in it's design for my wardrobe.  Always worth checking their site though.

            Generally extremely good - fast delivery, wide range of products and excellent prices. Their own range clothing can be very hit and miss when it comes to clothes that actually fit properly but you take that risk when you pay such good prices. Their deals on the better quality stuff work out brilliantly and I have bought several items of footwear which have all lasted a long time.

            Think twice before you order from ASOS, as what you receive might not be what you've actually ordered.Long story short, they advertise clothes with other clothes on top or underneath and don't state this anywhere on the site which leads to customer being confused and order an item that doesn't match the reality.It happened once this winter when I ordered a knit dress supposedly with a mesh part underneath but I only received the knit part, however I didn't bother sending it back even though I was annoyed by the way they tricked me into buying something that I believed looked different. Now we are a few months later when I order a nice slip dress with a mesh part on top, however I only received the mesh part. When I contacted support (as believed they've sent a faulty item), someone confirmed that the item is faulty indeed and promised to send me another one. Today I received the other one only to find out that they've sent just the mesh part again. Annoyed, I contacted their incompetent and rude live chat support ( I am a live chat support agent myself and I found the customer service unacceptable). This time they confirm that the dress is actually the mesh part only and after I ask how am I meant to wear a see through dress only and more importantly WHY do they advertise 2 different items and make it look like it's one whole piece and don't state this anywhere on the page they say ""I'm sorry but since this is the right dress there's nothing we can do"". I ask why do they present the mesh dress with another one underneath they reply that ""obviously their models cannot wear a mesh dress without clothes underneath for obvious reasons"", however if you go on their website and search for 'mesh dress' you can find plenty of other similar dresses presented with the model wearing just underwear underneath. When I asked to speak to a manager/supervisor of course I was asked ""what outcome am I looking for"" and of course I wasn't given a chance to speak to someone in charge.  Now I have to return the dress and pay for post taxes as I live outside the UK and HOPEFULLY they refund me (as I see other customers comments I might not be lucky enough to receive my money back). So the OUTCOME I'm looking for here is to warn people to think twice before and WHAT they order from the website.

            Asos seem like a great site to order from but theyre actually quite sneaky in certain aspects so just beware before ordering. I wouldnt bother ordering anything fragile as it most likely will be broken and you will have to return it. I once ordered £250 of goods from the site and they were totally crushed into a really small box, which I find totally inadequate and thoughtless when you're spending that kind of money. The customer service come across as being annoying and very false, plus it costs about 20p/minute to phone.What has made me leave a negative review however is that I recently placed an order and used a promo code they had which was 10 pounds off when you spend 75. Unfortunately one of the items was damaged and I had to return it, This item i had already ordered once before and was damaged hence why I asked for it to be refunded rather than replaced. After sending back I was only refunded 15 pounds rather than 25 as they deducted the whole of the promo code from the amount paid back to me. I contacted customer service and they would not agree to have somebody in a higher customer service position contact me about it. If I had known this would happen I never would have used that promo code I would have used my student discount.Even after explaining I have spent thousands of pounds with asos over the last few years the advisor would not get anyone else to contact me. Be warned of what seems like a good deal as it may end up not being.

            I ordered a $80 dress, and received a package — a belt, $5 value, with a label that said ""dress"" on it. Do not tell ASOS customer care if you get a different item, they will keep your money hostage ""until they receive it back, it is their policy not to refund before then"". Now I'm praying it doesn't get lost in the mail so I can get my $80 back. They will advertise sold out items on their site.

            Ordered few items for my wife's birthday on 22/05/17 for next day delivery as we are premium customers. Received a confirmation from dpd on 23/05/2017 for delivery. Never turned up. Contacted them through live chat and was then told I'd have to wait 4 working days for them to investigate. My wife then called there customer service team to see what was happening then they resent the package out on the 23/05/2017 for delivery on the 24/05/2017 and were told we will get a confirmation for delivery. We didn't get a confirmation so it is now the 26/05/2017 and no delivery. Just spoke to customer services and they are quite appalling to be fair they don't know what's going on and as a sorry gave us a 10% discount off our next order. Don't think I'll be ordering again as her birthday has been ruined along with the fact I've spent over £150 so asked for a refund instead because of all the waiting at least can give her the money and she can get what she wants herself from somewhere else. Only to be told will take 3-5 working days to get a refund. Pathetic service. Been customers for at least 6-7years now never had an issue with them but seems like there starting to get lazy. Be warned guys it's an absolute nightmare sorting issues out with Asos. One more customer lost.

            ASOS has repeatedly sent me the wrong size for my order then tried to blame it on me. They keep passing me off to different customer service personal who say I ordered the wrong size, despite the fact that my receipt CLEARLY states that I ordered the right size. I even provided screen shots.They are a UK website, so I ordered a UK 32G. They keep sending me US 32Fs. They referred me to their sizing guide, which didn't help their cause because it states ""ASOS own brand bikini tops come in UK sizing, please see chart below for conversion to EU and US sizes"". Therefore, if I order a 32G, I expect to receive a 32G, no matter where I live. End of story.I tried to refund and re-order as they suggested, but they STILL managed to send me the wrong size. TWICE!Yesterday, I asked to speak to a manager. They said they would have someone call me this morning. Still waiting! Pretty sure they are blowing me off.All I want is to receive my order in the correct size. THAT'S ALL. I don't understand why this has to be so difficult!!If you are looking to receive your order exactly as you ordered it, I would NOT recommend doing business with this company.Update: Only after I started posting public reviews on Facebook did they finally call me. The guy one the phone was super rude and condescending, saying I was wrong because I lived in America. What it came down to is they didn't have the size that was advertised as I had ordered, so they figured they'd just send me a smaller size instead. Get bent!

They brought me the wrong shoes I ordered a week before a wedding I was attending (needed dress shoes).they ended up getting me trainers..2, when I spoke to them about my shoes they told me one of the options I have is to re-buy my shoes and pay for the next day delivery, when I already payed for express delivery. It was either that or they arrive 2 days after the wedding.. 3. when we reached the end of the conversation (and by end I mean they stopped talking to me),  they said they'd get back to me in 72 hours.. But of course after 72 hours I contacted them and they didn't even bother to reply. Horrible horrible HORRIBLE...

I contacted them and they said they'd resend the shoes. They then sent me BLACK shoes with white stripes. I complained again and all responses are ""there's nothing wrong with our warehouse, send the shoes back."" This is abhorrent. They clearly have issues with their warehouse team but now I have shoes I never ordered and they're demanding i send the shoes back?? Such a waste of time, not to mention money that I will have to spend to package up the incorrect shoes. They're refusing to refund or even admit fault! They even had the gall to suggest they've checked with their warehouse and their stock is fine, so I should go and re-order the shoes!

            Prime Delivery is really good and I like that they use DPD as now as much better than Hermes.The UK call center is also a big plus and their A list section is great for collecting loyalty points.A Big downside is the Facebook chat support - you get passed on to a different person with every message and its really impersonal and frustrating. From my experience of being on the chat for more than an hour nobody seemed to be able to help 'Clear your cache and cookies' was a solution I got 3 times when I had explained I had already tried that.When you compare to other companies they are good but just need to work on the more personal support as other than that product variety, returns and delivery are really good.

Basically I order a leather jacket (£140) from asos Curve but I've not received the jacket nor will they refund me because the driver has said he's delivered it. They won't refund me despite me telling them that the signature has been forged and the driver admitting that there was no answer at my door when he tried to deliver the item. If there was no answer clearly I didn't sign for the item!! ASOS answer to this is contact the police!! Will never order from them again because for me there is no reassurance that I'll get my goods or my money!!

I went through customer service who told me i'd have to send back the wrong item in order to get a replacement or a refund. Since i did not go out of my way to repackage the item and go to the posthose, on my busy day, they refused to refund my money or send a replacement. This is 100% ASOS' fault, why do i have to be the one to fix this by going out of way, instead of just fixing it themselves? I did not receive the item i ordered and they refuse to refund my money.

            I purchased a dress from Asos 4/2017. I did not get my item but they got my money. The only way to speak to someone  is in an online chat. I contacted them several times, in April , and was told they would look into it. I contacted them again, in early May, in an online chat, and was told  they never were contacted about my missing package. I was then told AGAIN, they would look in to it. Lesson learned, don't order from a company that doesn't have a contact number. Also, anything over a $140 needs to be sent by UPS only, so it can be signed for. I will never shop with them again and advise other not to as well.

            PARCEL DELAY. WORST customer service EVER, i thought back in Africa where i come from they have the worst customer service, but apparently they have a competitor now ASOS.NEVER BUY FROM THEM.

            Asos is horrible!!! If I could give them a zero I would. It got to the point where I was so sick of repeating myself (apparently, different people respond to your message each time, and don't bother looking through the thread, and frustrate the heck out of customers) that I wrote a detailed blog post and uploaded all of their ridiculous responses, and proof that my package never arrived, and was actually delivered to another city! And they won't refund me.

            Their recommended sizing is absolutely terrible. Firstly they recommended me two sizes bigger than I currently wear. I order in the recommended size and none of the items are a nice fit they come up at least two sizes smaller. I wear the same size in all other stores but asos are terrible. Not everyone is a stick, they do not accommodate to different shapes. Not everyone's hips are just 3-4 inches bigger than their waist.

            No Responsibility for Their OWN MistakeI'm pinching the title from a previous disgruntled client - I think they're AWFUL!!Ordered a pair of DUNE wedding shoes - DUNE card enclosed said there should be spare heels tips - they weren't. The packaging was also poor; very little soft tissue paper and no soft storage bag - plus the box was damaged.I made enquiries and basically the inconvenience was to be all min. They suggested - as they had ABSOLUTELY NO SPARE HEEL TIPS! [??] - that I return  my shoes, get a full refund then re-order . With my wedding 8 weeks away! Why should I run that risk of no replacement stock when heel tips could have been posted in a jiffy bag?In summary, they've got no replacement shoes as well as no heel tips! But still they suggest I return the shoes and get a full refund - and re-order!! Bunch of numpties with NO CLUE about customer service...oh I forgot! I CAN get a 10% discount - whoopy-do! I'll pass thanks!

            I placed the order of product from ASOS and they sent me the wrong sized item. When I asked to return and get refund for all expenses, including import duty, they said that I have to be responsible for import charge by myself though they make the mistake. At the end, the customer care service recommended me to  use corresponding emails with them as proof with custom office for tax refund. This is so unprofessional. I will not buy anything from ASOS again, ever.

            It is now 3 days past my latest delivery date, after having to send numerous emails in both English and German to find out where my parcel is, I still don't have a concrete answer. Friday should have been my latest delivery. I was then told it would arrive Saturday. It did not. Then I was told Monday. Once again it did not. Now I ask again, and they cannot even tell me when it will be delivered. I am seriously beginning to wonder if when it does arrive, will I have the clothes I ordered in the box. Extremely disappointed, this was my first time ordering from Asos. I will not be making the same mistake again.

            I ordered a few bikini tops for a trip to Mexico and I received the wrong item. I found that the only way to contact the company is through social media which is very annoying, slow, and impersonal. They sent the right item months later- too late for my trip, therefore I returned the item. It has been longer than 2 months and I have yet to see a penny of my $150 despite the communication online. Don't expect to be treated like a priority if you have issues with an order, the customer service is horrible at ASOS, despite the cute clothes. The worst part is that I have not felt assured that I will receive my money- they are well obscured behind the walls of social media, and it seems they never deliver a sincere message. Sometimes I don't even know if I am speaking to an actual person- it was a horrible experience and I won't shop here again. Who knows if I'll get my money.

            I have used asos for many years and have always been a loyal customer. However, my most recent experience has really put me off and I want to make sure other people are aware of the bad customer service if your order does not go as planned. One of the items in my order was actually out of stock and was refunded. I only know about this because of a Paypal notification. I received no email from asos and when I enquired about it, all I got was excuses and insincere apologies. Nothing was done and I was ver disappointed, particularly when so many other large online companies go above and beyond. If you have a difficult order or are worried about something going wrong, don't order with asos. Stick to simple stuff only, their customer service is terrible.

            I've been using Asos for years and have never had a problem. However my most recent order for a pair of shoes has made me completely change my mind about them. I was sent the wrong size so I emailed Asos and waited for a reply...inbetween I spoke to them on Asos chat and asked if they can send the right size sent out while I return the incorrect size as I needed the shoes for 2 days later, each person said within 48 hours I should get some news from them...30 hours later, still no sign of the replacement and still no email. If I had been the one making a mistake on the order I'm sure Asos wouldn't want me to make them wait 48 hours before a response. This is the first time I've come across a company who takes this long to sort out a mistake. I'm done with Asos and don't intend on using them again.

Then when I requested the items I had actually purchased they said they would send it right away so I could have it on time. However when I heard nothing I contacted them again and they said the dresses i ordered were out of stock. So now they said I need to return the dresses to get a refund. They didn't seem to care at all not even offering a discount on a next purchase or replacing the items with something else.I have returned all 4 dresses but no refund. They're now saying I have only returned one dress. It's a complete scam. Do not order from asos.

            Booked a return collection with Hermes. Waited in from 8am to 8pm on a Saturday which was the window I was given. Wasted a whole day as they never turned up. When I contacted Asos to complain they told me to contact Hermes or rebook. (Hermes's website says in the event of complaints and non collection to call the retailer). There was a token apology and the agent was polite but no real sense of surprise or genuine disappointment. More a case of - ""oh, sorry about that, you'll just need to rebook"".  I finally got offered a 10% discount on new full priced items if i shopped again at asos in the next month - but that's just a ploy to get even more money out of you!! Furthermore this is not the first time this has happened. Last time the driver didn't show up on the day he was meant to and then left an angry voice message two days later when he finally decided to arrive  (and which hadn't been prearranged) demanding to know where we were. This shouldn't be happening ASOS and rather than just tell people to make new arrangements if it does - please do something proactive so that you have direct contact with drivers, can see where parcels and drivers are, can raise complaints or even better - just turn up when you say you will. Thanks for ruining my weekend and leaving me to sort out the mess.

            Really bad experience. After the order procedure they send the next day that on all the package customs and duty + shipping handling costs apply. I live in Brazil and normally the customs are only charged by the customs here in the country and not in the country where it is being sent from. The buying process appears to have free shipping, but it's a total scam. BE VERY CAREFULL WITH THIS SITE.

            Awful. Awful. Awful. My first time ordering from asos and I was so excited but was left very disappointed. I ordered a bikini and was sent two of the same tops instead of one top and one bottom (matching bikini) which is what I ordered and was clearly stated on my order summary. They don't have a customer service phone number. The only way to get in touch with anyone was to chat with a representative online, so fine. The first person I spoke with didn't even apologize for my experience or ask me what had happened. All she said is that she will escalate the situation and have someone contact me within 48 hours. Once I told her that I could not wait that long, she stopped replying to my messages. So whatever, I opened up a new chat to speak with someone else. Now, I explained my situation and waited about 5-10 minutes and never received a response. Closed that chat box and opened up a new chat box to hopefully talk to someone who could at least help me or give me some sort of information on how I could get a replacement sent out to me! Now, she answered and was very helpful. She even stated that she would express ship the bottoms to me. Unfortunately, the tracking number was going to be sent to the email on file which was expired. I had to disconnect the chat, fix the email and then speak with someone else. She gave me a reference number to give to the next representative just in case. Opened up another chat box, now this representative seemed very friendly. He was kind to me and said he would send out my replacement and that he would be back in just a moment. As soon as he said that, he disconnected the chat. Now that I've gone through this many people, I still do not know if my order has been submitted or anything for that matter!! Opened up a new chat box and explained the situation to her. I informed her that I had been disconnected on multiple times and that I just want my replacement order placed. All she responded with was ""sorry about that"" Lol.... everyone is so nonchalant and send the most careless responses!! She finally submitted the replacement order and did express shipping for me. She stated that I would receive the tracking number within 48 hours along with additional information. I have a feeling she didn't really place the order but we will see. So far, just awful awful experience. Told me to send the duplicate bikini top back within 28 days and that's it. Didn't give me much information on my order. They are just careless and don't know anything about empathy. It says a lot about asos if they truly do not care about their customers needs or how to show any sort of empathy when speaking with their issue. I love the quality of the bikinis that I received, but unfortunately, the lack of respect from their customer service team is enough for me to never purchase from this company. Spent three hours trying to just speak with someone who wouldn't disconnect on me and it still is not fully resolved. You think with this company being so big, they would have a great team behind them. The people who haven't had problems with their orders are lucky!! God forbid you ever have to speak to these stupid, careless individuals.

            Do not order from this place, I was looking for a dress for an event and found one that I loved at ASOS. I knew my event was coming up so I made sure to select a delivery date that would give me decent amount of time. Well, my delivery date came and went, when I DM'd ASOS to inquire, they said that my parcel had no tracking number. So let me get this straight .... you sent a $200.00 parcel from UK to Canada and didn't think you should use a shipping method with a tracking number?! I was told by them that I'd have to wait till May 5th before they will do anything about it.... that's 2.5 weeks from the delivery date that I had selected. Also, May 5th will be after my event.. No one seemed to care. No one offered to express a new one to me with tracking number, nothing. Pretty much, tough luck hopefully it gets to you on time. They got the money. Now it's not their issue.Seriously, $200.00 down, no dress and gonna have to rush to find something new to wear. DO NOT SHOP HERE!!

            They have a lot of very nice clothes and accessories by amazing brands, however their customer service sucks a**. Your order will most likely come after the guaranteed date. Otherwise, I do love their clothes but worry a lot about my orders never arriving.

            I've ordered regularly from ASOS.  I love that the returns are so easy and free.  Shipping always ends up being free as well, which is awesome, being in Hawaii.  It does take a few weeks to get here, but it is coming from the opposite side of the world. Quality of the items can hit or miss but most are  really nice. Plus they are incredibly reasonably priced and there are some awesome sales too. The one bad thing is that returns can take more than a month or two to process, so don't expect your money back right away.  I had to contact customer service for them to realize that the returns had been made and then I had my money refunded.

            Not sure since when they provide tracking number for international delivery (at least I got mine not sure about others). It usually takes less than 2 weeks to arrive at Malaysia which is quite fast and it never gone missing (touchwood). Website is easy to navigate, it accepts credit cards and paypal as well. Customer service is alright for me. Definitely one of my favourite online store :)

            Customer service level has got to be one of the lowest in the UK and most disrespectful I have experienced.Canceling orders without apologizing to customer's for the fact they have oversold a product is just absolutely ridiculous and for me is probably is just one of the many problems I have had in the past couple of months.Access to there staff via the online facebook and emails is for me rendered useless. You have to wait weeks for a reply and when they do reply, they change agents every single time. So in reality not one single agent knows what you are talking about because they don't have the previous messages. This can string out a basic request for a refund into month's, in my case 3 months.They do not really have a system in place to actually compensate customers for the time they waste and genuinely could not care less about there customers as they only care about money and for me have got to be one of the most ruthless and soulless companies out there. The fact that they hide their customer service phone number tells all for me.I recommend most friends to stay away from ASOS and look else where for products online.Shameful company.

            There was an issue with my order that I placed during a sale, when I approached them about the order the next day, they said ""no problem we can cancel the order and you can re-order it and you'll be all set!"". so they cancel it, and forgot to tell me that they wouldn't honor the discount sale code from yesterday so I lost the entire promotion. Super unprofessional. I don't suggest ordering clothes from them.

I returned the parcel with the pre-paid label.I cannot find the proof of postage receipt (yes it is my fault). I contacted Royal Mail and have been advised that ASOS will have the return number, as they post that with the order number when you receive it. ASOS is supposed to make a claim to Royal Mail as they paid for the postage!!!!!!!!!. Customer service is so BAD. They won't even look into. I'LL NEVER USE ASOS AGAIn, REALLY BAD COMPANY.

            I'm writing this review because I'm a bit shocked by the rating ASOS has here. I've been a very happy customer for over a decade...I started ordering with ASOS back when it was called As Seen On Screen. I make at least one order per week. Customer service is excellent - I have tried via the contact page and facebook. Hermes returns are free and collect from your door so you don't have to lug returns back to the post office. Returns are very timely and can be expected within a few days. Excellent next day delivery that even comes on a Sunday. I normally order in the UK but I've also made orders whilst in Europe and haven't had any problems. Huge range of brands at many price points. Some of the cheaper items aren't the best quality but you get what you pay for so I don't know why people complain about that. I've referred so many of my friends to ASOS over the years because they are hands down one of the best retailers out there! I can think of many retailers with a lot to learn from ASOS. Overall, excellent service and I really hope ASOS continues to be successful because my wardrobe depends on it!

            I used to be quite happy with ASOS. However, after ordering af wedding dress from asos own collection (which is not that cheap!) I was really disappointed. The dress was garbage. It look very beautifull, but the pearls does not stick to the dress at all. ASOS will not give any kind og refund on the dress. I had to sew all the pearls on again by hand (spend about 60 hours on it so far). Even when sitting with the dress in the hand, fixing the pearls, another 100-200 pearls fell off. They will not send me extra pearls for repairing it, so I have to cut i shorter, to use the pearls from the bottom of the dress to fix it. WOULD never recommend the ASOS bride collection. And not the one for bridemaides either.. One of my bridemaids ordered a dress for herself to my weding, and it was clearly used before, and very dirty (and that was not a part of the look of the dress)

            I've only ordered once and it's a bikini. It came fairly quickly and the item is great quality. My only issue is the bottoms I ordered in a US 4, came in as an XS. Size 4 is definitely not an XS. So the bottom don't fit exactly like they should because of that. Overall the product is really nice.

            I have ordered a lot from ASOS. I only had two bad experiences.I usually get my packages quite quick, so when I hadn't got it after 10 days I wrote to ASOS. They said sorry and send me a new package right away - my first package showed up the next day, so it was probably just the post office being very slow!I once recieved the wrong pair of socks and I was told the right pair was sold out, but I could get a refund without sending the socks back. So I opened the socks (of course, because I didn't have to send them back), but then the next day I was told I had to send them back, which wouldn't be possible once they were opened! I would still recommend ASOS though

            To be honest if I could give a rating lower than 1 star I would.Having lost my order - which was for my daughters Birthday , the courier company DPD insisted I speak to ASOS so that they could have enough information to start a lost parcel search . They gave me a number to call ASOS- which I did. The parcel failed to arrive in time for the Birthday and I then received a mobile phone bill of £18.32 for the phone call to ASOS- clearly on a ridiculously inflated premium line -  which they refuse to refund .I also wasted a morning of my valuable time. When I raised the issue via their on line ""service ""- misnomer if ever there was one - I was told they ""don't speak to customers "" so basically tough !Their on line customer service is nothing more than a blocking mechanism stopping them ever having to acknowledge poor service or customer problemsI would seriously encourage anyone considering using this company to avoid like the plague

            Very bad customer service. In the UK they do not have a phone line but only a chat function, well ok its 2017. But here comes the problem: The UK customer service cannot help me because I live in the Netherlands. The Dutch customer service has no phone line ánd no chat function, only email. Average reply time of their 4 emails: 23,5 hours. Would accept this all if they would help me but they did not. The package was not delivered by DHL (even the DHL customer service told me they could see on GPS that the deliverer has not been to my door) and then the package was returned to Asos. Asos cannot trace individual packages and they say I have to order again. Half of my items are not in sale anymore or are sold out. My package is still not at their depot but they are unwilling to pick it out and return it. This is very very very easy to do, I myself work with traceability systems so I know what I am talking about. They are holding my money for 4 weeks before refunding it so even if I could re-order the items that are sold out, and even if I was willing to pay full price for the items that are not in sale anymore, this is not something very easy to do for most people.

            I placed an order, on the day it was due to be delivered, I tracked it and found out it was damaged and being returned to Asos. I then contacted Asos to ask them to send me replacement products, they said if I wanted replacements I had to order and pay again but they wouldn't refund me until they received their parcel back which could take 7 working days to get back to them then up to 5 working days for a refund. I explained that the items were a gift and could not afford to reorder without my refund. They said they had a process to follow - at no point did they make any suggestion to try and rectify the situation. They said as soon as they had my parcel they would issue my refund. This morning I received an email saying they had my parcel - but gave only refunded one product! I went on site and used their 'ask me a question', the reply I got was that if I don't hear the other items have been refunded to sent them my tracking number. I tried to send them another message asking them to read the notes on my order as I hadn't even seen the parcel I wouldn't have a tracking number. Their website kept crashing when trying to send. I messaged them on Facebook to ask them to let me know when they were refunding the money they owe me as I wanted an end to this stressful situation - at this point I am missing a gift, my money and the time I have wasted going round in circles with their customer services. I have never experienced such awful service from any company and feel like I am being made to chase my own money. I will never use them again.

            Parcel company lied and said they had attempted to deliver. Waited in all day. ASOS customer service- 'sorry about that' and I can reorder. Items now out of stock. Company is too big for them to manage customer service effectively. I have been a customer regularly since 2003 and will be ceasing to shop with them after the response from CS. May as well have said 'ahh tough luck'

            I have received the wrong item on four different occasions over the past 2 years. Two of these were after I complained that I received the wrong item, and they just sent me the same horrible dress again. They don't actually read or listen to what you are telling them. Just try and ""resolve"" the problem quickly to get rid of you. Customer service is absolute rubbish. They offer you no compensation for repeatedly messing up. Now I have the hassle of returning 3 items I didn't even want due to their own mess up. You shouldn't have to work to be a paying customer. I have received a much better service from other online clothes retailers. ASOS don't deserve the business and I will be cancelling my account with them.

            I used to shop a lot on asos and since moving to switzerland I have not had a single order arrive in the estimated time, i've had numerous orders just not arrive and when I raise this with customer services the items are then out of stock and was just told i was being refunded months after ordering and emailing. No remorse is ever shown as if the service team are fed up dealing with so many complaints, I've also had some agents just end a conversation before I have finished speaking. To them, it is just another bad transaction. Too much time to be wasted in a shop that is not competent in their logistics and still attempts to ship to 100s of customers every day, not a happy customer at all.

            Super horrible customer service, don't count on your items arriving! I love asos clothing/brands so much that I keep gambling and ordering items, but I am ALWAYS disappointed. My items either show up months after their estimated delivery date, or do not show up. Was charged for clothes that I never received. When I asked them to look into the issue, they told me my clothes were out of stock and they weren't coming to me. They refunded me my money at least (3 months later), but had I not looked into the issue, they would not have. They do not care about international customers either, I can never track my shipping, so I never know if my items are coming or not. If they had a store in Canada, I would shop there every single day. But I probably will not order from them online again, considering my most recent experiences.

            One the worst customer services there is. I got two completely different answers regarding a parcel that has been delivered to the wrong pick up address. First I was told that they could give the delivery company a new order ""no problem!"" so to speak. After a few days and still no delivery at correct address, I contacted them again. This time I was told that they could not help me due to security reasons. The most annoying thing is they kept referring to the chat I had with customer service the first time and trying to convince me that I had been advised differently than what I actually was. I.e. customer service made up advice that I had not been given. They are a joke. No more Asos for me.

            I was ordering all the time everything at ASOS.COM.. but now i will not order anything... Let's discuss my story:I have ordered bag pack at asos and payed 27 dollars for this.. after 2 weeks i'm receiving i don't know exactly what it is... it is not scarf and also it is not hair accessorize but it is something like that. i have contacted with the customer service of asos and they told me that i have to return this item back, there is another problem i have to pay 30 $ to return back this item and you know that i have payed 27 for bag... it is funny that the cost of the bag for me will be 57 dollars.. also i have ordered Adidas gazelle 1 month ago and of course i have received wrong size.. i don't know what to do they are not helping me to solve this problem !!!! I'm shocked !

            Their product is okay but their customer service is a joke everybody is rude unpleasant stupid and not helpful. Security details are freaking hilarious and even blocks customers from getting help. Get ready to wait a week before you hear anyting back from them. They dont even have a phone line for customer service. What a joke. Overall not worth it. Products are just okay so buy from other stores with good customer service and an actual service center with a phone number

            Asos express delivery-I've used asos on multiple occasions and never having a problem up to this. However, on this occasion I had £82 worth of items in my basket, I then got a promotion offer saying spend an extra £18 and receive express delivery for no extra cost. I proceeded to find an item I wanted to get this promotion after doing this I went to the checkout and paid. The date of payment was 27/03 at 6pm so I was expecting the items on the following day or at the latest the 29/03. On the 29/03 I didn't receive my items so I was a bit worried. I went online and spoke to asos customer service advisor he then told me my item was sent standard delivery, which straight away made me ask him why when I bought the extra items just to qualify for express delivery.  His answer was ""if you changed your method of payment it may have reset the delivery option"" how can they justify this being the reason why? Even if this did actually happen, why would anyone want standard Delivery when they've qualified for express next day delivery? Personally I think the way the customer service advisor spoke to me was inappropriate. He wasn't apologetic he was blaming it all on me.

            I have purchased from asos now for around 5 times, my friends also purchase from Asos and the delivery is always on time, even before to when the delivery was expected. The things are exactly as in the picture, and the actual Asos brand stuff is very good, I ordered some Asos brand shoes and they are beautiful, comfy and just perfect.All 5 times ive purchased i have never had a negative or troublesome experience, even when I put the wrong email that I did not use anymore to my order, they changed it for me.so Yes, do buy from asos, I recommend it and theyre very trustworthy.If you have a problem, live chat is available so theres always someone that can immediately help you :)

Owning a business where customer service counts, and after now reading COUNTLESS reviews stating similar frustrated customer experiences, I don't understand how they are still in business.

            I have shopped online using ASOS for years, they have more stock than ever before, bringing more and more brands on all of the time.  i pay for the annual next day delivery which is amazing.  Although DPD (which they use) has let me down once, I cannot fault the site for their great customer service.  This is my go-to website when I need to grab a present or want some more clothing or make up. It's a shame not all of their happy customers write a review on here to tell everyone how great ASOS is, this would certainly out-weigh the amount of complaints below.  ASOS IS AWESOME!

            I've been shopping at ASOS for almost 7 years now. I've always gone in with level headed expectations and ASOS has always gone above and beyond. I've ordered from every category at many different times of the year, with several different discounts and coupon codes used. Clothes are great quality and they have a wonderfully diverse range. Customer service is incredible and the returns and exchange program is extremely useful. They recently accidently did not refund me one dress short after i returned some things i didn't like, i had a answer and refund within 1.5hrs. Shipping over the years has always been above board for UK to Australia shipping, and this comes from someone who often shops online and always shops from overseas online vendors. Shipping is a finicky thing that is often out of retailers hands and expecting ASOS to perform miracles is completely ludicrous. If you can't handle the online shopping experience without a tantrum contained within rediculous reviews, don't buy online.

            Today i found asos And was interested in trying the webshop because of a 20% shopping spree. After spending over an hour creating my wishlist i checken out At 11:45. I entered the code And it worked. But i forgot something So i went back Added it and tried again. At this time THE code stoped working. It was about 11:50. So i contacted customer support. After a 45 min chat they told me there is nothing that they could do because THE discount ended At 12:00. I told them i was checking out before that And also that At 00:18 they were still advertising with the messages. But still no service what So ever. I was willing To buy 8 products. But i left THE shop with nothing And over 2 Hours of my time wasted. I have screenshots of THE times advertised. Horrible service.

            I have placed many orders with ASOS in the past without trouble. My recent order has not areived and after several emails to customer service instead of giving me an answer to where my package is they have asked me 4 times to give them 48hrs to try an sort it out! It's been 2 weeks and they are still asking me to wait 48hrs!!! It's the worst customer service I have had to deal with. The will not give me a refund or resend my package. Their only solution is for me to wait until they get back to me after 48hrs, they never do so I end up sending an email and then they tell me to wait 48hrs again. They have done this 4 times!!! Terrible service

            ASOS charges extra for next day delivery, or encourages joining the Premier scheme to get it. However it is a risky service that can deliver anytime from 7am - 11pm. You choose next day because you need something urgently. But unless you are at the same address all day and all evening you may miss your urgent delivery. Work address is no good, home address is no good if you have a job you have to be at!For a premium delivery service why is the time range so ludicrous and risky for customers? This is poor service.

            I have contacted Customer service on two occasions now. Both times they have been staggeringly useless. Both times I have drawn out email conversations because I find myself repeating everything that has been said in the previously correspondence when a new handler responds. It seems as if all they are their to do is to provide a tick box response and unable to scroll down the email chain to actually understand the problem.

            Absolute rubbish. The worst thing was both times it was a gift from family. One time the item didn't fit so asked for a refund wouldn't allow me because it was shipped to Australia (it shouldn't matter) and I wasn't the person who ordered. Second time I got a voucher but it was sent in my trash and got deleted after a few weeks, asked them to re-send but it was a major hassle.Stay away

            (+) Can find a decent selection of clothes and a bargain now and then(+) No fuss returns (by post or drop off)(+) Delivery is usually pretty swift(+) Discount codes can be found(+) 24 hour help chat and generally they are quite courteous (but far less helpful than before)(-) Exchange rates are an abomination, we are talking like 50% difference to market rates in some cases, so if you are shopping from abroad, you might get caught out here. Despite the fact, that as of now (2017), the GBP exchange rates are notably low, you will find the rates used by the site are like when the economy was thriving(-) The way they handle some issues are really inefficient. For example, I recently placed an order but the discount code didn't get applied for some reason and I overlooked it. I messaged them around a couple of hours later to see if they can apply it retrospectively, but they said they cannot do anything, I must return the package to them once received then order again. I live abroad so it seems a complete farce to have to do this, overall, I end up waiting much longer and they lose out on having to cover the delivery charges(-) Some things are actually really expensive, but disguised as bargains(-) Sizing can be quite misleading, but I guess you can return it free of charge so it's not so bad

            I placed on order with this company on 3/2/17. At the time the had a discount with unidays offering 20% off instead of the usual 10%. I place my order and the discount somehow did not calculate properly so I contact their customer service immediately through chat. I was told it wasn't a problem and I would be refunded 16.90. I was fine with that. About an hour goes by I get an email stating the refund was processed and I would see it in 5-10 days. Time goes by about a week I contact customer service again stating I have yet to receive the refund I am then told oh we don't offer refunds you received the correct discount. I then showed proof of the original conversation and the email stating I was entitled to 16.90. And this was done after dealing with several reps because every time I would respond a different rep seemed to get my emails that alone made me angry. So one of the reps tells me my refund was sent to my credit card manually. So a red flag goes up I paid with PayPal how can you bypass PayPal and refund it to my card I did not have one on file with them! I asked the rep that very question and was told it can be done and to wait the full 10 days. So on 3/15/17 I contacted customer service again because I still have no refund and once again I have to deal with several reps before getting a concrete answer. I am then told by one of the rudest reps there it hasn't been 10 days only 9. Now I know I can count and I insist it has been sinnce this started in 3/1. He in turn says they are counting from 3/2 and the 10th day is 3/16. He also requested I send my bank statement me for that time period to show I did not get the refund which I thought was odd but I complied. Once I sent proof I was then emailed again oh you have to wait til after 3/16 and if it still isn't there to  contact customer service again. At this point I'm angey all this over 16.90 but I was determined to follow this through it has now become about the principle. I then open a transaction error cause with PayPal explaining what's going on just seeking further assistance in this matter. So I go ahead and wait til 3/17/17 and contact asos customer service again. Before doing so I attempted to log into my account and I get an error message you account has been blocked of course I am now confused. Why would I account be blocked??? I contact customer service through chat and the rep tells me I see it's blocked but I have to have another rep contact you. I asked well can you at least tell my why the account it blocked? The rep says no. I then contact customer service through email on the same email thread I had been using asking about the refund and the account block. I get and email back stating they are looking into it and that I dont need to send anymore emails. So fast forward to today 3/19/17. I get an email saying the account was closed because I opened the case with PayPal stating fraud and PayPal determined it was fraud and the company took a financial loss because of this . Any orders I place in the future will be canceled with no notice. Now I'm livid I check PayPal and the have not determined fraud and have not made a final decision. I was not given a refund for the 16.90 and instead of asos figuring out what was going on they just decided to block me from future purchase. I have never been so disgusted with a company in my life. All this over 16.90. So recap I still don't have the refund, my asos account is blocked and I am no long allowed to make purchases. Horrific, terrible and most unprofessional company every I would recommend no one ever shop with them again if they can be this petty over 16.90 imagine what they would do over a higher dollar amount.Update 3/21/17 So my refund saga continues since my last post I was contacted and told they would do an investigation. That was 3/17/17. So today I finally get another email saying they sent a refund to a card that is not active anymore I don't even know what card it is. The problem here is I paid through PayPal with an active card. So they decided to not use the original payment method and just choose a card they saw on my account. No one contacted me to verify this was ok or which card to use. This right here just shows how terrible their customer service is. And then on top of that told me my account will not be reopened until I close the case with PayPal. Are they serious???? So to sum up I still don't have the refund, I don't know what card they sent it to and my account is still not opened. I warn everyone beware of shopping with this company!

            This company is a fraud. They falsely advertise delivery dates to get you to make a purchase. Then it takes 3 weeks to get your items if at all. I ordered two items for an all white event I'm attending. I placed the order because the website said it would arrive on or before 3/14 which is two weeks before my event. The item never arrived and is now actually lost or stolen by the mail carrier. I've asked for a refund or a new shipment sent express so I can have it before I leave. All I get is generic emails with no answers as to when I will receive a new shipment or refund. A computer is generating their responses because none of my questions are being answered. There is no customer service within this company. No phone number to speak with anyone. If you have a problem you are on your own. They have insurance on all their packages yet they procrastinate about giving you a refund or sending a new order. Don't buy from this company and save yourself the stress and aggravation.

            hello, i have been using asos for six years now. i am from Romania and, at the time I started to order on asos, not many companies made online deliveries here. i never had an issue with the products or with the sizes. the prices are fair and the quality is sometimes amazing for the price you pay. they have delivered all the orders in time and they have refunded money instantly in case of any small issue. what's helping me most is their catwalk and their accurate description of the product. keep up the good work :)

            I didn't order anything fancy - in fact just a pair of trainers. Nothing else. Since it was a sale item it was immediately sold out. I was told mixed information some claiming they could replace it/ while others said it was sold out. In the end, my shoes were sold out and I had to go out of my way. Print out a new label and send back the wrong item they gave me. Had I known earlier I would've placed my order elsewhere. Since I've never had issues with ASOS up until this point. After much complaint one of the staff offered me a 10 per cent discount on all their full priced item. (Which is an insult in my personal opinion). And I kindly reminded them I already have that discount since I'm a full time university student. Overall, a complete waste of my time and personal resources to send it back to them. Now I have to wait over a month for my refund to come.

            First off, the fact that they do not have a telephone number to reach customer service directly, is an automatic no-no! Secondly, it takes them forever to process returns, and issue refunds. It took them over a month to refund me 245.00. Thirdly, I wouldnt need to return any of their product in the first place, had they got my order correct. I ordered a pair of Chelsea Boots size 12. They sent me a size 10 right shoe and a size 11 right shoe!!!! They sent me a pair of pants that was damaged and too small. When I confronted them about it (via online chat) there was no remorse, they just simply asked ""did you return it yet?""  They have THE worst customer service, and honestly their product only fits a certain type of guy. I am an African-American male from the south and I realized that their product is not made to fit me. LOL. All in all, they have POOR customer service skills, and as of today I AM STILL WAITING ON MY REFUND!  ... What a bloody shame!

I have been in contact with almost every employee  of Asos costumer care for the last 2 weeks and the they keep saying that they can't not see there is a problem regarding my account so they do not understand why I have issue placing an order.

Item ordered and wrong one received so returned for replacement which again wrong item received and substituted for a cheaper item in completely wrong style and colour.  Then told item not in stock.  Customer service a complete waste of time - so unhelpful and do not seem to know their stock.  Offered a ten percent discount on next order  and  only after asking but waste of time as already have an SU card and would not risk a third time.

            I pay for a premier account, which includes next day delivery. I ordered 2 items which were due to be delivered the next day. 2 days later I still hadn't received my items (1 of which was a gift I needed to post to a friend), I looked on their website and couldn't see a phone number - I needed an immediate response so I dug around on the internet until I found one and called to speak to their customer service team.The person I spoke to was rude and abrupt, disconnected my call after 15 minutes telling me there had been a problem with the order, one of the items was now unavailable (the one that was a gift) and the other would be reordered and dispatched the next day. I called back saying that was not good enough, and after a further 45 minutes on the phone was told they could offer me 15% discount on my next order. Since they'd already left it too late for me to order another present for my friend, and I already get 10% discount as a student, I said I felt this wasn't good enough - I had paid for a service I had not received. Eventually, however, I got so frustrated with their awful customer service I decided to leave it and just steer away from using them in the future, once my premier account had ended. Fast forward a month and my phone bill arrives in the mail, I find that I have been charged £25 for the privilege of this hour on the phone. I contacted their customer service team once again and was told that as they don't advertise their number on their website, they were under no obligation to do anything about this (despite not providing clear pricing information for a premium rate number as per their legal obligation). I will NEVER be using this company again and I strongly encourage you to do the same. Their customer service is awful unless you complain through public channels. No interest in helping customers, only maintaining a public image on their twitter/facebook pages.

The delivery originally got refused at the click and collect store. This happened twice and when I rang up to say I need the delivery on the day they've told me I'll receive it. I was told it's not possible, which means now I'm boarding a flight tonight without the special presents for my friend. This is really disappointing and will never buy anything on Asos again or use click and collect service as nobody wanted to help in taking the extra mile to get the delivery out to me on the day promised.

            Honestly so disgusted and disappointed in this company. For anyone looking to spend on this company please take my advice and SAVE YOUR MONEY. I've ordered from Asos now twice and BOTH times my items have been ""delayed"" and I've received within 30+days from the day I bought it. Ridiculous. Normally I wouldn't even mind getting it at a delayed date, but when I originally made my recent purchase I noticed on the date of delivery that they stated ""no later than"", which like everyone else I assumed I was safe receiving it before my event especially how they emphasized the ""no later than..."". As I was expecting my package on the date, it never arrived. As an extremely frustrated customer that now has no outfit to wear on a very important day, I took to their live chat, and all their customer representative offered me was an insincere apology, and told me that they were able to do nothing about it(BOTH TIMES). I then asked them to send me some sort of proof that my package was sent on that day and they claimed they were unable to do that for me. As a customer and having this now twice happen to me, makes me wonder if this company even ships their packages on the date they say they do, because again I find this extremely ironic having the same exact thing now happen to me twice. The reason I'm so frustrated is because of how established this company claims they are, yet their delivery takes months. I've ordered from @missguided and @boohooofficial before and to my understanding when they send internationally (free at cost), they actually send the package no later than a week. After my last experience I know to never spend a penny on @asos , and will make sure to advise others not to as well!

            I've returned some christmas gifts to you the 28th of december and Asos received the items the 5th of january. My girlfriend bought the items and paid through Paypal and they told her to update her Asos account with her credit card number, because they cannot make a refund through Paypal. Fair enough... this update was made the same day. Every time she tries to mail Asos, so that they know that the account is updated, they keep telling her to update her account. THIS IS ALREADY DONE! Now, over 2 months since they received the items, i still haven't got my refund!It's great with free shipping and returns in Denmark, but it's my last time shopping at Asos.

            If I could give them zero stars I would. I ordered a bikini set from asos and received two bikini tops. When I tried to correct the order, I found they have no US customer service phone number, so I had to DM them on twitter. They then told me that they could not replace the wrong top for a bottom because it was then out of stock. They basically told me sorry I was out of luck and to just return my items, so I did. I was then only refunded for the incorrect item and not the other item I retuned. I returned two items and was refunded for one. So currently I am out 30 dollars and 3 weeks with no bikini to show for it. Never order anything from this store, because anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Their company is just total chaos, and I don't know how they've held it together so far.

            I ordered my bridesmaid dresses from ASOS's TFNC Wedding range (which i highly recommend as they are great value for money).It turned out i had ordered the incorrect size for one of my bridesmaids and had ordered the items over 2 months ago.We decided we would like to order a slightly different style of dress from the same range to better suit the bridesmaid but due to exceeding ASOS's return policy, though this may have meant me being out of pocket. I was able to chat to an ASOS customer service rep about my issue via Facebook messenger on a Sunday evening where I was promply responded to, they advised to return the dress and if the warehouse is happy with the condition they may be able to refund me the money. If not they will just send the dress back to me. In the meantime i ordered the different style dress and returned the other.ASOS refunded me for the dress on return, even though going by their terms they didnt have to. For someone planning a wedding this was amazing!Highly recommend!

            The entire experience was horrendous.  My order was 8 days late to start with.  When I got it, the suit jacket and pants were from different die lots so they did not match.  We didn't notice it until I had it on out in the light.  I asked them to send me a pair that matched and they refused because I had put the pants on and taken the tag off.The customer service person was rude and offered no solutions.

            I ordered four pairs of shoes for an up and coming wedding for next day delivery.. I received a box ( very large and extremely heavy) of dog food!!.. spent an entire week of comunication with ASOS and a total of 6 different poeple only to be told today - a week later that they have cancelled my order as mine went to someone else... so I have wasted a week of my time with no alternative and been left with a box of dog food.. I don't own a dog!!. And no shoes for the wedding... total shambles of a company, impossible to speak to the same persons more than once so you have to explain your story to everyone..I asked to speak to senior management and was ignored. I haven't been offered any form of compensation for my appalling experience and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.

            Very disappointed, requested my parcel be delivered to store on a specific date, parcel never arrived, contacted to re-arrange delivery and they said they had to deliver to a different store and not for 2 more days, when the day arrived I had to phone ASOS for an update on the whereabouts of my parcel, they informed me that it had been returned to them. They refused to sent it back out to my address. The are going to take atleast 7 days to process it as a return and even longer to return my £400. Fuming to say the least. Items I wanted to buy are immediately out of stock! Shop somewhere else!

            They take forever to credit your account.

            I just recently started shopping at asos and absolutely love the assortment of clothing they offer. However, the shipping and customer service sucks so bad that I do not know If i will continue to shop with them. Both times I have ordered from them needing the clothing for a specific date and the package didn't arrive when it said it would. The last time I ordered from them, I even signed up for the $19, 2-day shipping for a year so I could ensure my order would arrive in time.  Two days later I went to go track my package because it said you would arrive on that day and it just shipped! I contacted customer service who basically said they couldn't do anything for me and when I asked for my $19 back they said they would refund it but cancel my yearly shipping plan?! Great customer service. Not to mention when I placed my order it told me it would be there on the day i needed it but that was obviously a lie.

            I had not received my birthday code, so I kindly asked them why and whether I could get one generated. They said because my birthday had passed(2 weeks after) I couldn't not get a code, that was not sent to me to begin with. First they claimed I wasn't opted in to emails which in my account states I am. Which is a glitch in their system but ASOS did not even apologise for their glitch at all. Another customer service staff claimed I was lying and that I had received it. It seems like they were making up excuses in which they took none of the blame. They did not even try to listen to me or help in the slightest. This is one of the worst customer service I have ever received.

            To keep it short and simple:I'm not sure why so many people are complaining about poor customer service?I had a delivery half an hour ago and a brush was missing from a set I had ordered. I had a chat live to customer services at ASOS and within 5 minutes, a new one has been replaced and will arrive tomorrow, for free. And to top it off, I don't need to return the old item either. Incredibly happy with customer services at ASOS. I order from them very regularly and have had nothing but a top class experience. Good quality clothes, lots of deals, and an amazing delivery service.My only niggle would be that a few months ago I ordered a couple of items and one didn't arrive because they had sold out. I was refunded before delivery, but was a little disappointed that they let me buy it when it wasn't in stock. But haven't had that problem again.

            On the 24th of November 2016, I ordered with ASOS for the first time and what usually would have been a straight forward process of buying the clothes and then receiving them with DHL in a couple of days ... turned out to be a real mission where even customer service didn't know what had happened to the order although they were forced to get in touch with DHL itself. All in all, their customer service is very poor, as ASOS hardly replied in a timely manner ... if at all; and given the nature of having an order worth 220.-Pounds gone astray ... I would have expected a little bit more of a forthcoming attitude, initiative and most importantly better communication in solving the delay as fast as possible. What actually happened in answer to my various enquiries via e-mail which never received an answer, was simply this: ASOS simply kept altering the delivery date on their website in regards to my order and that's about it; —albeit, all items of the order were in stock at the time of purchase!Since no communication was possible and I kept receiving no replies, I was eventually forced to warn ASOS that I would issue a Paypal dispute since more than 2 weeks had passed by then with no delivery or any concrete information provided, which prompted finally a reply, which simply stated:""Thanks for getting in touch about your order 237210482 - I'm sorry you're still waiting for your goodies to arrive.I don't have all the information to hand to give you an answer right now, however I'm working with our carrier DHL to find out for you. I'll be back in touch within 48 hours with an update for you.If you have any other questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to get back in touch.""—which, as it turned out was some kind of template answer, as I didn't hear back from ASOS concerning an update within the promised 48hrs. Fortunately 1 week later, with a total of 3 weeks waiting having passed since the date of purchase, the order was delivered after all.Three entire weeks with DHL for a shipment across Europe to Portugal; without any customer care or real assistance ... ASOS simply let the customer hanging, or wait and figure things out for himself; way to go ASOS, I'm definitely not shopping here again or even recommending this online shop further, since there exist plenty more online retailers that respect and truly value their customers.

            Placed my order on 21 Feb, items were dispatched on 22 Feb and reached me today (28 Feb). Very fast delivery. Only qualm is that the Nike Swoosh Cap in White (GBP12) I've ordered is currently on sale at GBP 9.50 (-.-"") but since I've gotten it at 18% off, oh well. It's better than in the pictures, thought it would be the ordinary rough cotton handfeel kinda material but it turned out to be quite like dri-fit material. Also bought The Ordinary Co Rose Hip Seed Oil to try. I'd recommend friends to buy from ASOS but probably only from the reputable/known brands.

            I use to love shopping with ASOS, but their customer service and business has gone down. I ordered a two piece outfit and was able to use a 20% off discount that they had sent me. So, all of a sudden I get an email saying the top is out of stock and the pants are on their way. They refunded me for the top. I then go to their website and see the top is still in stock. Confused? So was I. I contacted their customer service via chat and spoke with Lydia, who was very rude and defensive right off the back. She told me she couldn't give me the 20% off the top and basically deal with it, not her problem. So, they wanted me to reorder a top they cancelled that was instock for more than I previously paid for it.  I'm not a sucker and this has been a very bad experience, that has left me reconsidering shopping with ASOS in the future.

            The quality ranges so greatly, some pieces will fit well and last a few wears others can barely make it through an evening. The service when something does go wrong is brutal so make sure that what you're ordering is the perfect size (good luck with returns) and goes always to the right  (and exceptionally clear) address so that there are no hiccups. If you need customer service it won't be there for you.

I love my online account and the reward system (by the way it doesn't really make sense if you are already a premier account holder because you get most the rewards already, ie free next day delivery would be good if you could look into that) but every time I've tried to talk to the customer service department it usually takes an age to speak to someone and get an answer. SO long. That's by social media, phone, email and chat. Also, putting a link directly to 'Customer Care' not 'Help' on the main page would be so much clearer to customers.

I have both times order a pair of ray ban sunglass, the first time  i bought a pair for a christmas gift. They arrived the day before christmas eve and was the wrong color, asos solution was to return them, not extra help or anything. I had to give the for christmas eve and had a lone chat with asos, whom just wanted to return the glass evendo i had to use the for a christmasgift otherwise they told me that they would have a problem with there inventory. I dont get how it can be my problem as a costumer? The next pair of ray bans arrived correctly but they were missing a case, i was told by someone in costumer service that the only solution was to return them if i wasn't pleased with them, they did want to send the missing case after. The sunglasses are sold out, so it is not really a solution to send them back. It is really sad to see how they have lost their good costumer service!

            Just a quick FYI to any/ all customers reading this. Do not purchase from this company unless you have extra funds to not only pay customs charges but then to pay large sums of money to return items to them even if your reason for a return is that the item was falsely advertised on their website.I purchase 8 identical items for my wedding, used the size chart to order sizes and received items that looked NOTHING like the item that was on the website. I contacted Customer Service to see what they could do to help me out as I am in Canada and returning the items would cost me another $60. Keep in mind that the items cost $130, I had already paid $40 in customs charges that I wasn't going to get back, and the items I received looked like maternity clothing instead of the photo online that looked great.I was told ""the Manager has agreed that you can return the clothing"" ""you are responsible for the postage"" ""I have done all I can do"".I shop at ASOS all the time and am a loyal customer and they weren't even willing to work on a solution with me. Please don't trust these people with your orders.

            I ordered quite a few cloths when there was 20% off but one of the items was faulty with a tear in the stitching so I sent this back for a replacement but they refunded me instead. When I contacted them they said the item wasn't in stock at the time of refund but is now and offered me 10% off instead of the original 20%. Wasn't happy with that at all. Why should I have to pay more because of thier so called insufficient stock levels. Would not use this company again!

            I ordered several (3) pairs of jeans that they advertised as in-stock on the website.  They arrived much later than the email notification specified, and then when they did come, two were the wrong style, but correct brand, and the third was not even the right brand.  I sent them back and was told that one of the 3 was actually not in stock, and they would send the correct style for the other two.  They then sent the EXACT SAME incorrect jeans a second time.  I've now alerted them to this fact, and it's been more than two weeks and they still cannot even tell me if ""the warehouse"" has the correct jeans that they are still advertising as in stock (the ones that I've already paid for).  They will respond to online chat and Twitter DM's, but everyone says the same thing:  we're waiting to hear back from the warehouse.  No action, not helpful.  There is zero excuse for a company this size having such poor inventory management and customer service. I will NEVER buy from them again.

            Bought 17 dresses and sent 3 items back to be exchanged for different sizes. Got a confirmation email of the exchange. Waited for a month and having not heard back, contacted them. They said that they had refunded me for the dresses due to a system error and now the dresses are out of stock. If they do come back on stock I would have to snatch them up one by one and pay 3 delivery charges when my order qualified for free delivery on the first place! Disgraceful and an absolute lack of client care. Won't be purchasing from them again!

            I ordered a number of items in the ASOS sale on a Sunday and items were due to be delivered by Hermes on Wednesday I received all the expected email confirmations and when at the end of Wednesday I still hadn't received my items I checked the tracking to find a 24 hour delay in delivery, this was a courier issue with Hermes as they had possession of my parcel.  I still hadn't received the parcel by the end of the day on Thursday and contacted customer service at ASOS as Hermes advise, emails went back and forth and they requested I allow 24 hours for them to look into it and get back to me. It's now Tuesday evening, the tracking states returned to sender as requested so confused I sent another email. The last 3 emails have gone unanswered by ASOS so I started a live chat, this has led to me being told that I will not receive my items and that I now have to wait 7 days once they receive it back from the courier, a process they say was started on the 3 Feb, to receive a refund. I informed them I found this unacceptable, the reply said they now had to close the chat!! Apparently that's how ASOS deal with their customers when they are having problems. I have no idea when I can expect my refund, they have had my money for over a week with no items being provided to me and a potential wait of another 2 weeks for my refund as they have yet to receive the parcel from the courier. They did advise that if I wanted the items I would need to re-order, I don't think so somehow!!!!!! Awful service, I can't even make a complaint as they don't respond to emails!!! Very very very poor, left with an unhappy customer!

            I ordered a pair of high heeled sandals for a wedding in the Asos sale. When they arrived, one shoe was a size 6 as ordered, but the other was a size 8 and both for the same foot! It was in an unmarked badly damaged brown box, not the original box for the shoes, which makes me think they have been returned and not quality checked before being put back into stock. Furthermore, when I contacted Asos to make them aware of the mistake, they were incredibly dismissive. I was originally told I had a new pair of the correct shoe on it's way to me, which did puzzle me as I knew they were out of stock online. 2 days later I was finally told that they weren't 'whizzing' their way over to me, because they were out of stock. As they couldn't provide me with new shoes, they asked that I return the pair and as a gesture of goodwill because they were for a wedding, I was offered a measly 10% discount. No consolation at all considering I already get 10% off with my student card! Very poor service, very dismissive advisors, will not be shopping with them again!. Ps. Still waiting on my refund too!!

            Unfortunately, ordering from Asos is very expensive for Canadian consumers. I paid $60 in customs to receive the item, which I understand is not the fault of Asos. But then to return two out of the four items that did not fit came to $98. They should really work with their international partners to facilitate free returns.  Can no longer afford to order from here.

            Appalling Customer Service and a dishonest practice being carried out there. My daughter ordered an item that was never delivered to the intended recipient and Asos/DPD claim  it has been despite not producing the requested POD.They claim that they have my daughters signature  but  she was hundreds of miles away. DPD say they have closed the case and Asos refuse to refund the money. They claim to target the 20 something age group on their website and I reckon it's because it's a vulnerable age group rather than for any other reason. I just wonder how much  money they are making from students and young people by this dishonest practice. I have read many other such reviews which is quite alarming.  In addition my daughter doesn't know what else to do and they refuse to deal with me. FUNNY THAT  !!!

            I have been shopping at ASOS for about a year and a half. Always loved their products. Timely refunds and delivery. If you have a problem and try to get any results from them, beware and don't waste your time to get it resolved. I've only ever had 2 problems with no results. The latest problem is they have blocked my account for something they have named ""suspicious activity"". What that means is beyond me. I have tried to find out and am told on 3 different inquiries that they would get back with me in 48 hours which never happens. I have given up and will put my money someplace else. Maybe an American company with a phone number attached!

            Hi there:The reason I’m writing to you is because I am very dissapointed with the after sale customer service and extremely sad with your customer care. As a loyal customer I have experienced a bad treatment through your after sales team ( still waiting for a response, since once month) and I have tried to contact you several times regarding this complaint with no succesful communication from your side and making excuses about the busy moment during Christmas time. I bought this two items in November through your website. And expected the delivery at home. No one knocked on my door or tried to contact me on that time but the items where supposed to be ‘ posted through the letter box’ ( which I never allowed in the first place). After this I have tried to contact the company at least 7 times, via website chat, contact us and email. All of them unsuccessful and disappointing. They always said they had to investigate and never came back to me again. I have bought several items in my life in this company and I really think this is not the way to treat your customer!! I am still waiting for a response of WHERE ARE MY PRODUCTS AND WHY DIDN’T ANYONE COME BACK TO ME? Very poor customer service, difficult to contact the company and very bad after sales department. Please find here a prove for  one of that times:Hello, Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback. Your comments will be looked at by our team to help us make improvements to our Help pages.

            I have been ordering from Asos for 6 years now - a long time and a loyal customer. I had received wrong items in the past but they had handled it very well - sent me the correct item, no questions asked, as it should be. Recently, I noticed they changed their shipping policies. It used to be free shipping internationally, not anymore - the first red flag. Now, in my most recent order, I received the wrong item. They asked me, a customer, to go out of my way to package it, go all the way to the post office, spend my own money again and send the item back. They sent out my order again and I received the same wrong item AGAIN. I even said I would send them a picture of the wrong items with their labels as proof. After they said they would get back to me within 1-2 days, I waited TEN DAYS and then I had to email them again to see what they would do to fix the problem. They sent me the same response - send the item back. Completely unacceptable. Now the original item I ordered is out of stock in my size and it seems they are unwilling to give me a refund. NEVER order from them. They make a lot of mistakes, trust me, but now they seem unwilling to resolve customer issues (and I have been a regular customer for 6 years, they can see that in my account). In the past, they offered a 10% off coupon when they made a mistake too, now absolutely nothing even when they made the same mistake TWICE. The clothes often aren't even that nice - very hit or miss. Half the time they don't look how they do in pictures or are bad quality. Not worth the experience.

            I've been shopping with asos for some years now and it's my preferred way to shop for fashion.Great range & good bargains to be had in their sales/outlet sections. I get free next day delivery, and returns have never been an issue. Timely refunds and no quibbles.There has been one faulty item returned, and again, no questions asked.I have communicated with the team on social media and have always had polite responses.Will continue to shop with them.

            Incorrect delivery timeframe was set from the time of purchase. The checkout screen displayed 4 business days for shipping and turns out this is only for US customers. I am dumbfounded to discover that their website is unable to recognise the shipping address (which in this case was CANADA), to display a shipping timeframe for Canada. So, in the end, I could not receive this parcel in time for an overseas trip I needed the parcel for! While the parcel was in transit, I contacted the customer service team THREE times, where ALL three times, they were really unhelpful, unapologetic and inconsiderate! All three time, the agent purposely ended the chat, which I felt was EXTREMELY rude! I would NEVER shop on ASOS again. The worst online shopping experience ever!

            ASOS has some good brands to offer, but when it comes to prices I think you may find cheeper out there. However, they often offer discounts. So, if you are really interested in purchasing a certain item and cannot find it elsewhere, it is a place to consider. I like saving things in my preferences and waiting for some discounts; but unfortunately I never manage to get disounts for the items I would like to purchase. Or, they get discounted when there are no sizes available. I don't get it...why discount an item that is out of stock? It makes no sense... Anyway, I did manage to make a few purchases by now, and overall I am pretty much happy with them.

            Sent the return parcel on 13 Dec and got an email saying the parcel reached their office on 3 Jan - and no refund.I contacted them on Facebook message, they are saying my name shown on account is different from the delivery name, so they requested me to update my name online before they could help. I don't get the point at all as I already provide all kinds of personal information to verify my identity. Even I'm not that person, the refund would only go to the card I paid, what's the matter? Is it a lame excuse for pending the process?I would never buy from this company again.

            Their customer service is a joke. Every query you email them gets a copied and pasted response. I have a feeling they're not using actual human beings anymore. Even when you reply to them, it will be the exact same copied and pasted message. Good luck getting a response on Twitter. I had to wait six days for a response once. Seems the only way to get their attention is to shame them publicly on Twitter to respond back to you.

The staff are limited in what they are ""allowed"" to do, there phone line is GROSSLY understaffed! 10 minutes waiting for it to be answered, AND it's not freephone, so that costs the customer! Then when I comment on the length of time it took for my call to be answered I'm told they are not really set up to take high volumes of calls, there's only a few of them there . We'll surely common sense tells you that you should employ more staff to answer the phones! Your phones always got calls queueing, so get more staff for gods sake!

They would not just exchange the dress or send her a new belt.

            The first time Asos messed up my order by sending me a damaged customer return as 'new' goods, I let it slide.I even brushed it off when their customer service refused to give me any form of credit for the week that it took to get the goods replaced, despite the fact it was down to their poor quality control.Now one of the orders I placed from them has been lost. Okay, not their fault I hear you say. True.But what is their fault is their blasé attitude about it, the fact that they take days to reply to an email when I send a reply immediately after they send me an email. What is also their fault is that they do not prioritise customers when their orders are messed up. I understand that they're a student-focused brand, therefore I would expect them to employ students. But the way their customer service treat the customers, with their all year round slow communication (don't let them fool you that it's just a 'busy' period, their website says that 99% of the time - maybe hire some more staff if you're that busy guys) and their pre-typed 'I'm sorry your order was messed up but have a generic reply which doesn't apply to you emails' which do absolutely nothing to solve the situation, is just ridiculous.And yes, if they don't like your email then they will ignore you guys.Just about the only good thing about Asos is their free returns. Expect everything else to be a disaster!

            I ordered a good amount of items to try out from ASOS as a first-time shopper. They appealed to me because of the wide plus-size selection, reasonable shipping times, and the fact that they pay for my country's VAT and import fees. So I place my order, a week goes by...the expected delivery date comes, so I check my tracking number and nothing had been updated for 6 days (red flag #1). So I wait a bit for the Post to come by my building and maybe ring me to alert me of a package...instead I received an email that ASOS received my return package and will process my requested refund (red flag #2). Note that I never even received the package! How could I possibly request a refund for items I haven't tried yet? So I used their Chat system and while the representative was kind, it was a waste of time. They said something went wrong during shipping and the package came back so they issued a refund right away instead of alerting the customer of a problem (red flag #3). They also said that if I still want the items I can just place a new order. Mind you, when most stores encounter my negative customer experiences, they offer compensation for the difficulties: free shipping, or a coupon code, or a discount on one or two items. A small something to ease the frustration of my purchase going south. But do they seriously think I'm going to give them more money when they did nothing to ease that frustration, especially as a first-time buyer? Nice try.

            This company is built on lies and avoiding contact with its customers.  When you purchase items from them with 4 day shipping they'll assure you that they will have your order delivered by a certain date. It won't arrive, it won't arrive a week late, but more like 2 to 3 weeks late.  The company will do absolutely nothing about this except send you emails stating ""I see your package is on its way, sorry for the delay!"". And then when you call the shipping facility after 2 weeks of no delivery, the shipping facility will tell you the package wasn't sent yet and in fact all that was done was electronic shipping information was created.  It is not and will never be worth ordering anything from this company!

It is torn on both sides, taped together, huge tears in it. I open up the package to see 2 of my 3 items missing from it PLUS the one item that was still there (a pair of adidas) shoes looked worn and box was torn. Worst packaging I have ever seen. I was so upset and coincidentally there is no number or CONTACT US area on their website. How convenient! Every company has a way to contact. When I click on my order there is no place that says ""PROBLEM WITH ORDER"" like other websites have. They do this for a reason people. I will never order from them again. I called and called and have not been helped or even apologized to.

            I have ordered a lipstick and I have received the wrong color for 3 consecutive times. At first I thought it's just a random error, but upon I received the wrong item again I started to suspect there is probably something wrong with product SKU. So I chatted with the CS,  sked whether there would be someone manually check whether it's a correct item before they posted it again, they just tried to avoid that question and  insist what I ordered should be what I received. OK...so the third time, I still got the wrong item, thanks. And I chatted with the CS again, and you know what, she immediately asked me to return the item and not order this again. I said I need this in urgent actually it's unacceptable that you need to ask your customer to go through all the hassles again communicating and returning, and never be able to get the correct item !  ASOS do need  to compensate customers' loss with this. And unbelievably the CS asked ""Can you please tell me what loss you've incurred as a result of the incorrect item being sent to you?"" which sounds so unfriendly and rude - do they think the time i used on all the hassles wasn't a loss? I need that for an important event and now I didn't manage to have it on time. It spent me 2 weeks trying to sort things out. And then ridiculously she said she had to end the chat.

            Situation: Sitting in a hotel out of town when I see package has been delivered to my building and I signed for it. Arrive at home days later to see note saying package is in the bin outside of my building, but don't find package.Rising Action: Explain to Asos customer service that I was out of town, my signature was forged, neighbours didn't sign for package, received DPD note saying that package was in the bin outside, and I could't find the package. Asos customer service say they will thoroughly investigate in 48 hours. I patiently wait for someone to contact me asking for evidence that I was away, and my signature was forged by driver, and my package was left in a bin.Climax: Asos get back to me about 2 weeks later saying that the drivers GPS shows that the package was delivered and I signed for it. Shocked and outraged, I explain that no one contacted me to ask for the hotel invoice or images of my actual signature that show that I was out of town and my signature was forged. Even stranger, why did the driver leave a note saying that my package was in the bin if I signed for it?Falling action: Skynet takes over asos customer service, they disregard the actual evidence, and respond to all my questions by saying ""We are unable to process this further, the investigation was thorough, the case is closed""Catastrophe: DPD says asos is responsible and I should raise a claim with them. Bank says they can't refund me because I paid by debit card. Asos ""skynet"" says their investigation was ""thorough"" and the case is closed.

Each call promised a response within 48 hours and a week later I am still waiting!  I even wrote to the CEO of asos and did not receive the courtesy of any response.

            I have ordered stuff from asos many times and they have never failed me. I don'y understand how most of the reviews are so bad? For me, the orders arrive in just a few days even though I don't even live in the UK. You can always track your order and the clothes are always in perfect condition.

            Perhaps most people come to this website to complain about their bad experiences (as I am about to do in regards to Topshop), because I've never had one bad experience with Asos!I've been ordering things from Asos.com regularly since 2012, and I've never been happier with an online retailer's performance. Every one of my orders has arrived, on time 99% of the time, and there has never been an issue with the items, packaging or payment. Asos currently offers free returns from Australia-which is a service I hope they will continue to provide.A couple of weeks ago I made a purchase of about 6 items, and I decided to return 3 of them via 'Parcelpoint', a free returns service offered on the Asos website. All I had to do was put the items back in their original packaging, reseal the bag (with a clever sticker that is already included), book the return with Parcelpoint, print off the label and tape it on, and drop the  parcel off at one of the numerous Parcelpoint locations near me. I received a full refund through Paypal no more than 3 days later. A bra I sent back didn't even have the tag on anymore (I took it off by mistake), and yet Asos accepted the return, no questions asked.I've recommended Asos to all my friends and family, and will continue to shop there in the future! It's surprising and disappointing to see that not everyone has had so many easy experiences with the company as I have.

            ASOS is great if everything is going ok. However, if something goes wrong then prepare to fall into a deep pit of the darkest despair. They can only be contacted by email, Facebook or live chat. The only people that can deal with complaints are the call handlers meaning that they just tell you what they can't do, there's no way of getting anything but the most basic problems resolved and worse of all, no one takes ownership of a query. I've spoken to countless people over several weeks, none of whom read the whole thread before responding and meaning that someone will ask a question, you reply instantly, then need to wait another 48hours (at least) for SOMEONE ELSE to pick it up and ask something totally unrelated as they have not bothered seeing what went before. Their Facebook page is full of people complaining as it's the only way to get a response and it sounds like a lot of them have it a lot worse than me, but I can assure you it will be the last time I ever use the site.

            I ordered a pair of $100 adidas shoes for my mother in law at the beginning of December as a Christmas gift. Here we are, January 7, and I still do not have the shoes, asos has not provided me with tracking or a refund. I have sent multiple emails asking where my package is and all they can respond with is ""our team is looking into it and will get back to you within 48 hours. Guess what- I've been asking where my order is for weeks now. My mom ordered two pairs of shoes from them and both arrived with such battered and beaten shoe boxes that you would have thought they came from goodwill and have been there since 1970. AND they were both the wrong sizes she ordered.I am so upset that asos has made no effort to refund me or AT THE VERY LEAST figure out where my package is. It has been a month since I placed the order and they charged me.

            I ordered a dress December 2016, I paid for the two day delivery service so I was suppose to receive the package in 2016. When I contact them about it the lady I spoke with said that the package is in America but and is delayed at the ups office. She said I would receive the package no later than January 3rd 2016. I didn't receive the package so I reached out to them again, this time I spoke to Robert, he said the package is still at the ups sorting office in Kentucky, and I should give them a day to see what's the hold up. So I took the initiative to call the ups headquarters to see why was there a delay. Someone at the ups headquarters said that the package did not leave GB. So ASOS this is for you. I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 3 YEARS AND, BUT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PACKAGE AND I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND SINCE I DIDN'T RECEIVE MY PACKAGE AS YET AND IF I DONT GET MY BACK BY THE 1/9/2017.

            Bought an ASOS gift voucher for a family member as a gift, for delivery via email on Christmas day (2016). ASOS took the money promptly from my bank account mid December on the day I ordered the voucher (funny how this always works without a ""glitch""). When I ordered the voucher online using ASOS website I scheduled an email delivery of the voucher on Christmas day...it was a gift after all. At the point of order, no indication of any problems or that delivery of an email would be a problem. Come Christmas day, no sign of the voucher email, same on Boxing day. So I contacted ASOS customer support and was told emails can arrive up to 24 hours after the day they were supposed to be delivered......uuummm..... I thought traditional mail can be delayed, wasn't aware that email can take 24hours, maybe the internet was taking a holiday!! Anyway ASOS then contacted me again on the 27th telling me a different story, this time they announced they had a ""glitch"" that affected their email service. In other words their IT system didn't work. I'm sure i'm not the only one affected by the ASOS email ""glitch"".My advice to anyone considering buying an email voucher is DONT BOTHER.....ASOS service is a joke, they couldn't even manage to deliver an email on time....they mess up a Christmas gift and offer up nothing more that a pathetic excuse for a sorry.

            You make one typo in the delivery address and guess what? You can't edit it, asos can't amend it for you, they won't even contact Hermes ( the delivery company that can only be contacted by the retailer and not the customer according to hermes) to change the address. I sent them a query right after i made the order, and they still couldn't help me. Told me that the parcel will probably be sent back and get refunded, then you can reorder the product again if it was still in stock. I contacted Hermes and they said that only the retailer can fix this problem. Umm? This is ridiculous? I felt like Asos ""customer care"" made little effort to help me and didnt really ""care"" about the situation. I'm pretty sure that there is a lot they can do to help me but they obviously couldn't care less about customer experience. I don't think I will ever order from Asos again which is disappointing because I'm a regular.

            I ordered a voucher for my sister's xmas present to be delivered by email on the 25th, however she did not get the voucher until the 29th. Why is a mystery - it was literally just a voucher to be sent to her email address. The response I received from ASOS customer service (eventually after chasing for 4 days) was 'she has the voucher now' - kind of takes something away from a xmas present when it's delivered 4 days late! And I have never received an apology or a response to any email since then. I do not know why they offer the option of sending the email on a certain date if they are unable to do so. Beware if you are sending someone a voucher as a present!At the same time I made and cancelled another order (within 5 minutes) of actual clothes for someone else. 5 minutes is well within the hour turnaround for cancelling orders - yet my bank account has been charged. When I tried to find out why some 'customer service' adviser on their webchat told me I would get my money back within 5 days and then cancelled the chat.

            I ordered items for almost 100 euros today. To hours later I wanted to buy an additional item (and therefor spend even more money). But because this item was only 25 euros, I'd have to pay delivery fee.So I contact their so-called customer service, and ask them to treat it as one order, so I can save the delivery fee, because I just placed an order for 100 euros.But according to Nabinul, who had a hard time understanding me and answering my questions, that was just too bad for me. It was two orders, and even though he/she could see that I actually have placed an order way over the minimum, I now had to pay the extra fee. And then he/she advised me to think twice before placing an order next time and just closed the chatting window down.WHAT THE F***? I've never experienced such an small way of thinking and I feel scammed. I've been a customer for so long and spend a huge amount of money, and now, they won't even do the effort and help a customer. It's rude and totally stupid that you have to pay extra money when you actually just want to buy more stuff. It's scamming people!Maybe the online customer ""service""is people from India or an isolated island in the middle of no where. Because I've never seen such a poor customer service.Never again!

            Every time I've ordered from here it's always been positive. Never a had a delayed delivery, never had a faulty item and if the product wasn't up to my preferences, they would happily refund me. The site makes life buying and in cases returning clothes extremely simple. For those giving harsh reviews I was really surprised seeing as I've rarely had a difficult experience with ASOS.

            I ordered a dress for my baby shower. The item arrived dirty and the zipper was broken. I connected with the customer support team and they could not send a new dress as it was sold out. I needed this dress for my baby shower and did not have ample time to order something else. I was told that I would be refunded for the repairs and when I sent over the receipt for a $25 zipper replacement, they told me they will give me $6.25 as a ""gesture of goodwill"". As a loyal ASOS customer, i felt insulted and lied to. Terrible customer service!!! Moving forward, I will be sure to take my money elsewhere. Shame ASOS!

            It's clear, from doing my own online searches, that ASOS is having major problems in sending out gift vouchers.I ordered a voucher 4 days ago, the payment was taken from my account immediately, but the voucher still hasn't arrived.I've sent various emails and tweets to them and have received only one reply, stating that they'll get right back to me.I'm still waiting.It's clear others have been waiting much longer.You can't call them and they seem to have no intention of honestly updating loyal customers as to what's going on and when or if the problem will be resolved.It's absolutely atrocious service and despite the fact that I've spent a small fortune with them over the past few years, I definitely won't be using them again - there's simply nothing you can do to protect yourself when an ordered goes wrong.

            I'm writing to you because I'm so upset about my parcel from Asos not being delivered as promised on Christmas Eve.  I was told in an email to wait in began 6am and 10pm and to expect the delivery during that time. So I did.  At 5pm I noticed I had an email from yourselves to say that the driver couldn't find my house and so the parcel would not be delivered.  I phoned your team to ask what on earth had happened and why I hadn't been phoned for instructions.  A member of your team said that the driver had finished work and was not available.  This was at 5pm so why was I being expected to wait till 10pm? I know that my parcel number was linked to my phone number so why no phone call?  The woman in your help desk then asked me for further instructions to get to my house. I said that I didn't want the parcel delivered any more.  The parcel obviously contained Xmas presents and it would be too late by the time she'd rescheduled the delivery.  I had bought them only because they could be delivered on Xmas day otherwise I would have gone to the shops.  The woman on the phone said she would be able to help me of I gave her further instructions, so I did.  I continued to wait for the parcel and it never arrived.  I checked my email and it said that my parcel had been re-scheduled for 28th January. So the woman in your offices completely ignored my request to not have it delivered and re-scheduled it! So due to the complete incompetence of your driver I don't have Christmas presents for my son's on Xmas day. And due to the deceitfulness of your office worker I am expected to receive the parcel and send it back to Asos myself! !!!I want to make it really clear.  I DO NOT WANT THE PARCEL any more.  The deal was I had it on Xmas eve.  YOUR company failed to do this.  It is your company's responsibility to take it back to Asos, not mine.  You need to sort this out.  Not me.  Your company has already ruined my Christmas.  Here I am on Xmas morning writing this email.  I work so hard all year and I don't deserve this.  I would never have done what your driver did.  I would have kept to my promise and delivered the parcel come what may.  I would have considered that inside was someone's Christmas present.

            It has now become clear from social media reports that this company is having a major problem with electronic delivery of the ASOS vouchers. The high seasonal demand seems to have caused their IT system to melt down. I ordered vouchers for two of my nephews at the beginning of December for email delivery on Christmas day. The money was debited from my account immediately. It is now 27 Dec and neither of the vouchers have arrived. The Customer Services Centre has been worse than useless in providing information as to what is happening. I sent them an on-line enquiry on Boxing Day and other than an automated response I have heard nothing. The website does not provide any information on the fault, nor does it provide a telephone number to contact to Customer Services directly. Social media fairs no better in getting information as to when the vouchers will be delivered. There seems to be no back up plan to deal with this eventuality and for a major on-line retailer this is totally unacceptable.

            The ASOS online chat customer service is terrible. I spoke to HAILIE in regards to my delivery coming late. She messaged a response saying that it will turn up tomorrow and then messaged ""I'm going to have to end the chat now"" and then proceeded to end the chat. I understand its Christmas time and there will be an influx in sales and deliveries but that is why 99% of other companies employ additional staff for the Christmas period so they can manage the load. I'm not happy with ASOS.

            I ordered a gift voucher for my son in law for Christmas. He got no email on the 25th which disappointed both of us. I emailed ASOS mid afternoon on 25th and got an auto response saying I would get a reply soon and no need to contact them again. It is the 27th and still no reply to that email nor an email with the gift voucher.I have just been in contact via chat to be told they have a technical problem and they hope to send the voucher within 48 hours!!! That will be 4 days late.  I asked for compensation for this delay but they said they don't give compensation. What sort of customer service is that? The delay is their fault - they should offer compensation for the inconvenience and disappointment. I will never order ASOS gift vouchers again.

            Shocking contempt for customers during their Christmas voucher saga. Vouchers weren't delivered on Christmas day as expected. Told to wait up to 24 hours, with no specific time given. Then told apologies for the 'confusion' and to wait up to 48 hours, again with no time or reason given other than an 'glitch'. I think they're just making up numbers at this point. So many people left disappointed or embarrassed receiving / giving an ASOS e-voucher for Christmas. Retailers love vouchers as it's immediate cash in their pockets, however, their contempt for customers when fixing the problem is disgusting. ASOS are forgetting (or don't seem to care) that the people who have asked for ASOS vouchers are likely to be some of their most loyal customers, who were looking forward to shopping the sale online. It's now almost the 27th December and most of the best sale items are sold out - meaning anyone receiving vouchers has missed out. However, they're refusing to acknowledge or respond to demands for compensation. They seem determined to make every PR mistake in the book. They should offer all affected a 50% off code so that they can enjoy the perks of the sale when their voucher eventually comes through. You'd think I'd asked them for their first born child, all I'd asked is for them to recreate the same situation I would have been in if I'd received if my voucher on time! They don't seem to understand that this mistake should be rectified at their loss, and not that of their customers.They need to put their hands up, apologise and go beyond just trying to shut up their customers. We're talking about people's Christmas presents, they need to delight their customers at this point!

            I've been a customer of asos for probably 8 years. Tried to place 4 orders over the past few months and not one of them went through. Doubt and triple checked it wasn't my card or my bank (used different cards and banks for two of the times) and it WASNT. Tried very very hard to contact customer service and they do not have a customer service number which is honestly crazy. If you want a problem resolved you just have to wait DAYS until all of your Facebook messages are answered. THEN they tell you over and over again that it was a problem with the card. The problem is with their website and customer service. So disappointing. Get it together ASOS.

            I have never experienced a bigger failure of a business in all of my life. I can honestly say the staff do not know what they are doing, the  management cannot tell the truth nor can you hope to ever receive the goods you have paid for ina timely fashion or wihout an argument.I have made two purchases this week, one via ASOS, the other Andertons. Both deliveries being my sons Christmas presents which I sadly needed to buy online as I was too poorly to go out to the shops. On the 22nd December I had confirmation my parcels would arrive between 1-2pm on the 23rd December. I waited in. No delivery, no call from DPD. I checked the online status of my orders, it read not able to deliver today, driver could not locate, update to follow, or words to that effect! So, frustrated my son's presents would not arrive in time for Christmas I call DPD. I was on hold for some 45 minutes but spoke with Brad. I explained the sitation. After some discussion, I was told he would upgrade me (how this is an upgrade I do not know given they had failed already to deliver my items) and that my items would be delivered between 8:30AM and 10:30AM on the 24th of December Chistmas Eve. To ensure that this would happen I asked to speak to a manager. I was told a call back from the manager would be received within 4 hours. At approximately 6PM I received a call from Anne. She apologised, agreed that somebody should have contacted me to ask for directions, and apologised for the lack of communication. She also confirmed the ""upgrade"" and that my items would be with me the following morning. At this point I accepted there was nothing else I can do but to wait as the only alternative Brad suggested was to travel from Doncaster to Lincoln to collect the parcels myself. 10:30AM Christmas Eve, no deliveries. I called DPD once again and was on hold for 45 minutes, the call in total took 1 hour and 15 minutes. On this occasion I spoke with Craig, he told me that my items were still actually in Lincoln and that they had not left as promised.I asked to speak to the manager once again.Craig told me that it was a 4 hour wait for a manager call back, I did not accept this and after a few words I was reconnected to the manager Anne who I spoke with the night before.She also confirmed that my item was still in Lincoln. She related to the Asos parcel. I explained once again that there was two parcels one from Asos the other from Andertons and that they fully aware of this as I had received updated email confirmation for both parcels this morning. Anne said she would authorise a third party courier at their expense, CitySprint. However this would only relate to the Asos parcel, the Andertons parcel was now locked in a trailer and Human Resources would only be able to access this on Wednesday the 28th of December. Clearly at this stage I was very unhappy and angry knowing my son would not receive his main present at Christmas. Anne said that she would contact Andertons as would I, Anne rang me back about half an hour later and told me that CitySprint would deliver my Asos parcel within two hours.By my calculations this would be 2PM. She also told me that she could not speak to Andertons as they were only open on a week day but that she had left a voicemail message. I explained that this was odd as I had already spoken to them myself, I spoke with a very helpful person named Matt Beasley. Matt also contacted DPD to help me, surprisingly he was told that both parcels were actually together and that CitySprint did not have any available drivers to deliver anything to me today. He spoke with somebody at the Lincoln depo and passed on details of all the contacts that I had spoken with. Lincoln depo told Matt that I was able to drive there and collect them myself but like me, Matt was not confident that the depot would be open, had I driven across to Lincolnshire. Matt had tried to speak with Anne himself but was told that she had gone home, nobody else at DPD was able to give consistent information to him.At 4:20PM CitySprint arrived with both of the parcels. Whilst this is the result that I wanted, arguing on the phone with 3 people at DPD, poor communication, poor customer service, and at least 2 and a half hours on the telephone, not to mention my anxiety levels that my son would not have his christmas present I can honestly say that this has been a very poor start to Christmas, and I would strongly recommend that businesses use alternative courier services as they cannot be relied upon and in turn reflects badly upon ther own business practice.

            I put two orders from ASOS on the same day, a dress and a pair of high heels.  What are the odds that they both came wrong.  They sent me an non-matching pair of shoes (two very different shoes in one box!) and a dress that has been obviously used before!!  The dress came with a strong smell of perfume and deodorant/sweat, wrinkles that form in the waist after you have been wearing something for a while and the lining had all the seams in the waist stretched.    Costumer service runs on a script as it's managed online.  They offered me a 10% discount which is obviously not at par with the conditions of the dress I received and their non-existant quality control mistake, and even more, based on the price of this dress ($178).I will be returning the shoes and the dress and hope they don't resell them and try to scam someone else.

            This company should not have any stars. I placed my order and everything went smooth, but I never got my order. When I contacted them they told me they could see that the parcel was delivered - when I contacted the GLS they told me that they never got the order from ASOS!

            This company ripped me off! I bought  a pair of boots for about £220 which arrived damaged. They had to be returned and I was refunded and given a voucher off my next purchase! I then purchased again using the voucher but was charged delivery which was supposed to be free as I was spending over £100. I called customer service and the adviser agreed I should be refunded the delivery cost, but I was told the manager would not allow this too happen. So my voucher ended up covering my delivery cost which was supposed to be free. I was clearly ripped off and this company is not too be trusted!

            I returned a few items from my order, but then I got refunded for the wrong (cheaper) items. So I receives 8 euro's less than I should receive. I have e-mailed the costemar service about 10 times, but they kept telling me that they were sorry they made a mistake but the couldn't give rest of my refund back. They weren't willing to find a other solution or a discount code as an apologise. Nothing. I still didn't receive anything, still very angry.

            I ordered from asos a ""pink oversized puma sweater"" and a ""corset belt"" and it said the delivery date was the 24th of November and it is now December 21st. I called the post office because it said the package was coming from the U.K. When I called and gave them the tracking number they said that the tracking number seems to not exist and the package was lost now there is an open investigation with the package. I tried emailing them no email back, I contacted them on fb they responded but then after I responded no response today I am going to try to call them. Very disappointed and irritated because I spent $90 on this package.

            I made an order and was very happy with the speed of delivery because it came as soon as it said it would. Although I opened the package to find a broken item (money box) which was wrapped in bubble wrap, I didn't open it further as I didn't want to cut myself. I got onto ASOS straight away and submitted a complaint about my item. I received a confirmation email explaining that they will contact me asap, although a week passed and I heard nothing. I emailed them again and they emailed back the day after saying that nothing could be done except a refund because the item sold out, and they had yet another unhappy customer pushed aside.No promotional codes or anything were given (usually retailers would do anything they can to resolve the situation and if they cannot, a promotional discount is given for the future).Never again, DO NOT SHOP HERE!!

            Did the usual, placed an order for it to not arrived when planned. Instead, recieve a notification from HERMES that is it being returned due to Incorrect address. It had not come to my Default listed address (no clue why they even have this if its ignored) but instead it had gone to an address I have not lived at for 2-3 years! Rang the help service, told that it would not be possible for them to reschedule the delivery or even supply me the parcel at all. That the order was now going to be returned back to sender (ASOS) via email notification to HERMES which takes 24-48 hours and then if i do want the parcel i will have to reorder. Explained that the Item is out of stock and that i will not be able to place the order, and they should just replace the order with my permission and CORRECT address.... But that isnt possible either, nothing but empty apologies given. Requested to speak to Manager or supervisor but told there is a 24 hour waiting list. Rang Headoffice directly, told again there is a 24 hour waiting but before i gave my details they hung up.NOT the first time i have been let down by this incompentant company which seems to only aim at displeasing its customers. If you are only a online shopping site, at least aim to do it correctly.

            I need to pass on my experience when I ordered a gift voucher - which is sent as an email with code .  I accidentally left out an underscored from the email address the voucher was to be sent to. I contacted them the next day (by live chat)  and explained and was told it would be sorted. After a week I re contacted them - had to go the same info and was told it would be sorted.  Still nothing! I tried to reach out to the email address I had wrongly entered and it would not accept an email - making me believe the voucher was never delivered.   Long story short - I finally received my refund after 9 weeks and many, many, forms of contact - email, live chat and customer service - which I was charged a rate per minute.  So please be aware.

When my item took 3 days to arrive, I sent an email showing my dissatisfaction that I was not receiving the service I paid for. ASOS then tried to fob me off with a 10% off code (I already receive 10% with my NUS card) which can only be used on full priced items. I then replied stating I already receive 10% off and that the code isn't of any benefit (I haven't heard back since). I won't be using ASOS again as I have lost complete trust whilst showing they don't care about their customers.

            As other people have written before me. I gave my order the 28th of November and was guaranteed a 4 day shipping. After a week I got an email that my order would arrive in more than one parcel. After my order didn't arrive for another few days I contacted the customer service. The answer was yes the plane was delayed your package should arrive within the next 48 hours. Of course it didn't, and I contacted again the customer service of asos. So now, my shipping is supposed to arrive the 19th of December. However, since I'm traveling I won't be back within the time frame of 28 days to return my shipping. The support chat ""felt bad about that but couldn't change anything"". Thank you asos for not delivering my package within 3 weeks and additionally now forcing me to keep all the articles. I have never been taken less seriously in my complaints and not offered any help with my requests. Never again!!!

I contacted asos, trakmypak and jerseypost and nobody responds. Asos had specific order times for Christmas so customers can get products by then and none of it is true! They shouldn't ruin people's Christmas and give people a date when they can't follow through it will arrive by then. One more week till Christmas and I'm hoping it will arrive sometime next week. Fingers crossed. If I do order from asos again I will use express shipping because standard is a joke. I will be extremely upset if I don't receive my products by Christmas and will contact my credit card company.

            Order some items from Asos a few weeks ago for an outfit for my Christmas party! Got an email on the Saturday from hermes to state my item will be delivered today, so I put a note on my post box to re deliver on the Sunday, was left a (sorry I missed you) card with ""I don't work Sundays"" on it! So Monday came around and I was at work and so was my partner, when I got an email stating my parcel had successfully been delivered!? When I arrived home I had assumed it had either been stuffed in my letter box or left with a neighbour!? It was neither of these things the parcel was simply not there! I reviewed the email again for any clues but noticed it said it had been signed for by me?!!!!!!!! I HAD NOT signed for this, so I did a live web chat which came back with nothing! I asked who had signed for my package and they couldn't tell me because apparently that can't see who signed for it!!!! I bit the bullet and decided to pay 13ppm and call Asos on 08701752638 spoke to a nice man on the phone and explained the situation! He was very apologetic and couldn't have helped me more! Because the item I required was for that evening there was no point me asking for them to send it again so I asked for a refund! He said they will be getting back to me within 48 hours with what will happen next! (I am still waiting as not 48 hours yet) He also described the signature to me which look like some letters and numbers? My signature doesn't have numbers!! This is crazy to me that a delivery driver would just sign it off as delivered and make me lose the money I've paid for their own benefit! The thing I will say is that I shall not be using Asos for anything else until the decide to change delivery companies! It tells you something when the man in the customer services says this is a very big problem for them! Change to dpd they are amazing!

            So far I've only received top service from ASOS. I paid £9.95 for premier deliver and it was worth every penny! All my items have been delivered next day by DPD who give you an hour slot and they've never been late. The premier service also includes returns labels, I sent a return through Royal Mail on Monday and I've received an email 3 days later to say the refund has been returned. So far I've not been able to fault the service or the quality of the goods.

            Ordered my package on the November 28th. It's now December 14th and my package hasn't moved in 2 weeks. Every time I email them or get in contact with them they tell me they will get back to me and when they do they just claim my package will be here in 48 hours and tell me my tracker (which is stuck in new york) will keep me updated. Package still isn't here. Leaving for a month in 2 days and I was hoping I'd have my package by then since it's the reason I bought it. Never ordering from here again

            I'm a nutshell, Hermes attempted the delivery of my parcel to my work address on a Sunday when no one was there. I expected it to be redelivered within next couple of days. Nothing arrived. I contacted ASOS via Messenger foolishly expecting a prompt reply. Nothing. I then emailed, had a reply two days later saying I would hear within 48 hours. Nothing. The response I eventually received via messenger was so patronising it was untrue. I replied but again no response. I resorted to phoning - after being on hold for over 15 minutes I got through to someone who offered me either a refund or replacement. I said surely it was easier to just their courier to redeliver. They said it was not. I asked for a replacement order & guess what?  The item now out of stock. I asked for a full refund and was promptly cut off. Absolutely dire service from ASOS. I expected better.

            I've spent well over £1000 with Asos in the last year, but recently had a couple of large orders where I needed to return items. I've had an operation so was unable to take the parcels, so was reliant on their Hermes pickup service. Over four weeks later and I am still waiting for them to collect. Pickups have requested by myself or Asos six or seven times, but each time the status just gets changed to delayed, or just stays open with no update. I managed to find a phone number for Asos Customer Care - not on their website, btw, I had to find it via Google (0207 756 1000 if you want to try) and have spent hours on the phone. On each occasion I have been told that they cannot contact Hermes but will email through another request. I don't understand how Asos can have a partner company such as Hermes but they have no way of contacting them. Utterly useless. I sent an official complaint via email over two weeks ago, but that has been completely ignored. I spoke to a guy on the phone last week and asked to speak to a manager. He said they have no managers there (?!) and he'd have to escalate it via email to one which would take 24 to 48 hours. Fine I said. A week later and still no call back. I then phoned again today and was told that because the items were delivered Asos had fulfilled their obligation, and because I want to return to Hermes I need to speak to them as I am now a Hermes customer. Yet Hermes say, both on their website and on their live chat fob off thing to contact Asos. It's bizarre. Asos use DPD for deliveries, who are fantastic, yet they use Hermes who are shockingly useless for their returns. Whilst they may be cheap, they still reflect on Asos, and Asos should think twice about who they partner with. As a long term customer of Asos I have had enough. I Should have been recovering from an operation, not getting stressed out about returning Asos parcels, and have had absolutely no support from Asos' staff, and have just been fobbed off. Their Facebook staff only seem to read the last message and just give me the same stupid reply, I've been repeatedly cut off when asked to speak to a manager or put through to someone in particular,and the fact that my official complaint has been completely ignored just tops it off. If anyone senior at Asos reads this, please contact me, as I can give you full details of the shocking support from your staff and names of people who need some serious training.

            I have been a huge fan of Asos for the past few years, annually signing up for the Premier Delivery service (which is worth the money - most of the time) however the past few months I have had nothing but issues with the company. The worst part of it, is that when you have a problem all you can do is Email or send them a message on Twitter, which then takes days to get a response!Most recent problem being that I order a size XL mens grey jacket and in response receive a medium grey jumper (that looks nothing similar to what I ordered) - Of course I contacted them by Twitter only to be told that it was a 'warehouse error' and that I needed to return the item. I did this reluctantly and requested a refund - to which I have not received yet after almost two weeks. Instead I chose to re-order the jacket myself in case it went out of stock, only to now have received the jacket again by ASOS after not even asking for it to be replaced!!This now means that I have TWO unnecessary trips to the post office through no fault of my own before I am able to get a refund, therefore my Premier Delivery is completely useless and unbeneficial, similarly to the customer service provided by Asos!!Its difficult because with the delivery service and vast range of products/brands, the website is a very convenient place to shop however lately the customer service and constant errors are making me re-think my choice to use them!

            Right now I live abroad and work and I needed some new work shoes and thought it would be a good idea to order from Asos. Worst decision ever. The first problem was that I needed the shoes ASAP so I ordered it on express delivery but the time limit was not kept - might have taken 4-5 days more which was a shame since I was supposed to wear some of the clothing in that weekend. But they were actually kind enough to refund the extra I had payed for the express since it was not right. Then I opened the package (which I had payed 37 € to get from customs) and then it turns out that it is not my order. I had ordered a pair of shoes and some clothing but instead I got a completely different evening dress. I tell Asos this and instead of asking me how we could solve the problem they just tell me that they have resend my package but now it is only containing 2/5 of what I ordered. It will now contain some of the clothing that I was supposed to wear some weeks ago and not the shoes that I actually needed. I told them that I no longer needed the items but they said it was to late now since they had just decided to resend things I do not need. Now I have to pay customs again for something I do not need. I do not live near a post office and it is great trouble and expensive to return the things from the Caribbean to the UK.... But they didn't really seem to care about their screwup. I spend several hours trying to chat with them but was disconnected several times so I had to explain over and over again. I tried Facebook and email but they really don't seem to care. Worst service ever received. Will never buy from them again. Now I am sitting with different clothing items I do not need and without a way to get a refund for it even though it was all their fault.

            They were helpless , and didn't apologies once for their unsatisfactory service they took up to 24 hours to respond and would then only respond when I asked them to on their main page . They had taken my money via PayPal which was taken out of my bank account , when I went on to my Asia account there were no purchases in my history . Obviously I was scared about this and they didn't help at all . Also said I would get my money back until Christmas which is ridiculous and meant that I had to spend double the money on this dress - that in the time it had been attempting to sort out had gone out of stock in my size - deciding on another size I ordered it and it was then estimated to arrive the day after my event .

            My order is being shipped to an old address across the country that I have no way of retrieving because of a glitch in their website (they even said it was a glitch.) The same thing happened to my friend. I was told I may not be able to be refunded or change the address, even though I contacted them before it went out for shipment. They told me they only thing I could do was contact them again after it's been dispatched and they cant try to have it returned. I have emailed them 3 times, messaged them on facebook, and tweeted at them and they are completely unreachable. I was able to call UPS and they told me the information that ASOS gave me was wrong and they could have changed the address the whole time, but now since I can't get in contact with them I will have to wait for my tracking number and then pay a fee to redirect the package. ASOS has been my favorite store for years but this experience and complete lack of customer service has discouraged me from ever ordering with them again.

I was the lucky person to recieve them next. I explained that I would like them replaced but due to our fat footed friend, in a smaller size. They advised this was against policy and would not replace them. After talking for 1 hour, it was agreed they would replace as per my request. They picked up the boots yesterday via Hermes. Today I find that in the chat they refuse the agreed replacement. No manager to talk to. If you have no issues, then they work.. The communication breaks down when you need their help. I would avoid if you like me cannot see much sense in these false promises. Even when they logged it all down, and i have it in writing. Thanks ASOS. BTW...they tell you in the online chat and twitter that there is not telephone number to call. Google does indicate a number and i do get through to people who apparently work at ASOS.

Mind you I shopped for 1 hour or more....so I instantly go to someone on live chat to change the address...this is within 4 minutes of placing my order my only option was to cancel and re order everything. That's ridiculous so I asked to speak to a supervisor...they said there is no number for us to call into (big red flag there) and than he just left the chat with no resolution or confirming that at least my shipment will be expedited like I also asked.So I email in.... again no help no acknowledgement of wanting to talk to a manager and have my shipment expedited.Finally after 3 days of back and forth someone calls me with attitude and totally disregards all my requests...still. I finally have someone get my package for me from my old address and what do you know.... I get an item with a hole in it...Seriously just go to The OUTNET or NET A PORTER asos shouldn't be a company they suck.

            I ordered 5 items. Had a delivery notification from Hermes for 13.00 to 17.00. Stayed in, no delivery. Then a notification saying a failed drlivery 3 hrs later but there was no card left.Contacted chat and spent more ghan 20 mins to be told that it never was a delivery snd anyway my delivery date was a day later so it didn't matter. I queried why it didn't matter that I had wasted a day off for no reason. When i asked for a transcript of the conversation was told it would be emailed to me as I was logged in and they had my details. One hour later no email so I contacted chat again (same name, probably same person). She told me I needed a reference number from the last conversation. I was never offered one and ehen I queried why as they knew who I was and the time they must have a log of the communication. Was told their system wasn't working so they can't trace the conversation!Apparently it's okay to keep me in all day vecause the item wasn't meant to be delivered until the next day even though the courier sent a tracking link saying it would be delivered. Incidentally, Asos delivery time is 7 days and they consider that reasonable. Certainly will not be using them again.

            I have been ordering from asos for so long! And the experience has been good until now. My order had to ve delivered on 5th of december. Well it didn't and i contacted customer care via chat. It took them forever to get back at me, they have no idea where is my order or when it's gonna be delivered. They said they would get back at me in 1-2 days! This is outrageous! They didn't even apologize for the delay! Is it so hard to say sorry??? I am so infuriated right now!!!!

            Asos is a great company i like how easy it is to make returns or exchanges if needed. The only reason i gave them 4 stars is because they don't have a customer care phone number to call here in the U.S. but other than that my experience was good.

            I have ordered several things from ASOS and this is the second time they mess up my order. I moved months ago and they sent my last order to my previous address even though my default address is my current address. When I received an email update from UPS with the destination, I contacted immediately. The first person ended my chat conversation abruptly after I told them that I was talking to them though my phone screen and couldn't change the browser to provide the order number. The second person also stopped responding after they told me that there was nothing they could do and I would only be refunded if the package is returned to them from the address they incorrectly sent it to. Since ASOS can't handle their mistakes, I contacted my credit card company and they disputed the charge. That's the last time I order anything on ASOS.

            I really love the variety of choices and great deals available as well as the aesthetics of the website and the simplicity of the app. However, ordering and shipping is where the problem starts. My very first time ordering from Asos, it took forever for the order to process and ship and I still received the wrong item. By that time, the item that I wanted had sold out. Customer service was not very helpful. I recently ordered from Asos during their CyberMonday sale. One week later, and the order is still processing. I have already received all the items from the other online stores that I ordered from during CyberMonday. Ordering and Shipping has been a problem everytime I have tried to use this website. Its very frustrating.

            I've always shopped on ASOS, however the past year or so I have been blown away by how amazing they really are.Firstly, in 2015 my mother was diagnosed with Meningitis. This affected me a lot, so I started to fundraise for the charity Meningitis Now. I wrote to many companies, ASOS being one of them, asking for donations. ASOS sent me a lovely (huge) parcel with items they donated along with a lovely note. It's not normal that a company would trust a 17 year old girl at the time with that, but they were so wonderful and encouraging which was brilliant and helped with my fundraising massively. Also, in terms of customer service, they respond to problems really well. Recently, my Cyber Monday order failed to process and I didn't get notified until the next day, meaning the 20% off code was no longer valid. This meant if I ordered again I would have to pay full price. I e-mailed ASOS straight away and they responded immediately and were very polite, passing me onto the correct person. They kept me updated with the process of my issue and then gave me another 20% off code to use.I would highly reccomend ASOS and trust them 100% as a brand.

ASOS staff are not trained in basic skills and it's a massive turn off for customers.I won't be shopping with ASOS again as a result of a series of bad experiences with rude ASOS staff. FYI it really isn't hard to be friendly and at least pretend to enjoy your job. Shocking.

            I see a lot of negative reviews on here for things like customer service or deliveries but not a lot on the one thing that truly matters when people are looking for reviews, the products. I've ordered from ASOS a bunch of times and I've also returned items and never had an issue with either. The 3-5 day standard shipping is exactly what it says, 3-5 business days for them to SHIP the product but that doesn't mean you will receive it in 3-5 days. I live in the US and it usually takes about a week for my to receive my orders. I've never had to deal with their customer service so I can't speak on that. The quality of the products I've gotten is really good but I'm sure it varies depending on what you get since they carry different brands. Don't believe the negative reviews this is a legit site with lots of cute options. A friend recommended asos to me a few years ago and I've been shopping here ever since.

            As a regular customer, I was astounded by their digraceful service in my most recent order. As my ASOS premier delivery had expired, I opted for the standard delivery which takes between 3-5 days at maximum however after 3 days my order had yet to be dispatched and was stated as ""Processing"" in the order status. I believed this to be a system error and continue to hope that the item was on it's way and would arrive latest within the 5 day period as promised. This was not the case, since after 7 days, I was notified that my item was finally dispatched, this was utterly disappointing since there was no message on the website to state that the item would take a week to dispatch. I believe the company clearly did not have the item in stock yet continued to present this item as available to customers. Furthermore, what really frustrates me, is that I was not sent an e-mail at any stage within the 7 days to apologise for this delay. They simply believe it is acceptable to leave their customers bewildered. I am now in a state of disappointment and sharing my experience on multiple review website, so that others are aware of there service, and what they are likely to encounter, when purchasing from ASOS especially with Christmas upcoming.

            I ordered an item on next day delivery. The item got lost. When I contacted ASOS they advised I would wait another 48 hours before they could advise where my product is. Who knows how long I would have to wait to actually receive the product after the 48 hours! I suggested they send me oit another product and take up the issue of the missing item with the their delivery supplier- but no, ASOS couldn't possibly do that. They would rather penalise the customer for the inefficiencies in their service. At no point was I offered any sort of compensation - not even for paying extra for next day delivery. Also, could only chat to somebody online - no actual phone number. Online chat is basically like chatting to a computer or robot - no concept of customer service at all and certainly not willing to try to keep the customer happy even though the error was completely on their side.

            Actually shopping on ASOS is brilliant- there are lots of products and they are good value. Problem is the TERRIBLE service. I have received several damaged items due to them being packed in a thin plastic bag with no protection- this included a £80 bracelet that I was told would only be replaced if they deemed it a manufacturing error, which meant I could have sent it off and them tell me ""no you did it so we will not refund."" Their customer service is constantly slow and ask irrelevant questions (why do you need my date of birth???) and they do not even read what you have written half the time. I have also had to return TWO faulty items in the last few months, one of which was lost in the post for 2 weeks before they would look at it. Sort out your packing/shipping/quality control departments! They are really letting you down!

            I ordered a top for my son and was informed by Hermes that it would be delivered to my home address last Friday ( a week ago today) The parcel never arrived but according to Hermes the parcel was signed for by customer (who was me but I wasn't even home but my husband was) and no parcel arrived. I contacted ASOS on Sunday when I returned home after a weekend away and I was informed that it would take 48 hours for Hermes to do signature check. 48 hours passed and I heard nothing so I recontacted ASOS and was told it could take up to 5 days. ...........I have still heard nothing. ASOS messenger just asks me the same questions, tells me to check with neighbours, look behind bins etc, which is totally frustrating as I have done all that (and its not my job to go to neighbours houses when Hermes says I signed for it). I have since been in touch with Paypal and I am hoping that they can resolve my problem. I will not shop with ASOS again, they have left me feeling like a cheat and a thief.

            I agree with people who might say that their service ain't the best. I think their chat-function on their website is truly worthless. However when I've spoken with their support on Facebook they've been quite great. Since they switch people who answer it might be difficult for them to keep up what the topic is about, but they still keep the good service and they are polite and helpful. They helped me when I wanted to send back a pair of jeans which were faulty. I didn't have the bag I got the jeans in nor the paper for return, but helped me well. The shipping might be +1 day other than said but otherwise really good. Unfortunately some things (don't know why) can't be shipped to my country (Sweden) such as NYX Setting Spray, which is unfortunate, and they don't say until I try to check out.

            The items I ordered arrived as promised (4day shipping)  which was impressive considering this was holiday week and I live in Seattle, WA. A little disappointed with the sizing of the item I ordered.  I'm 5 1"", athletic/  curvy build. I was excited that the petite shop had such variety to offer.  I ordered a high neck,  velvet bodycon dress,  it looked as promised,  but when I tried it on it was a good 5 inches too long!  And it didn't do my curves any favors,  either.  Surprising,  since I ordered the smallest size available: 2.  Kind of just straight up and down. Not sure if I'll keep out to have it altered length-  wise, as I really do need it for an event. Wanted to avoid all that bother by ordering petite to begin with!!  Shoes could have been packed better,  too,  box wasn't dented but shoes (velvet block heels)  arrived needing to be bent back into shape.

            Hello Asos, In my life I have never publicly posted complaints about anything, anyone or anywhere. But as I'm feeling pretty desperate right now about the poor service Asos has provided me within the last few days, I've decided to do so. For my birthday coming up next week, my boyfriend let me pick out a jacket on asos.com. I had my eye on a suede biker jacket for a while, and was so happy when Asos announced the Black Friday 20% Discount weekender. On Thursday the 24th of Nov. I placed the order using the Black Friday promocode. Happy as kid!On Tuesday the package arrived. It turned out to be the wrong jacket. Instead of the 207 (incl discount) biker jacket, it was a 50 euro New Look jacket. Nice, but not my thing. I went online as fast as I could and turned to the chat for help. Chat was busy. I tried PM on Facebook. After a few questions asked on the other end and I replied, nobody answered. I turned to the chat again. This time somebody was there. The guy told me to sent pictures of the wrongfully delivered item as proof, so I did. He said I have to sent back the jacket as fast as I can, and that he wasn't able to sent me the right item until the wrong jacket was back with Asos. I live in the Netherlands, so I knew that it would take days. I noticed my biker jacket was low in stock. But what if it's sold out bij then? He said, no worries, I'll make sure the jacket will be well on it's way. I'll pre pack it for you. Ok, I'm reassured now. I drop everything I'm doing and deliver the jacket to PostNL. The next morning (!!) the person that ignored me all day on Facebook decided to reply. ""Can you please sent me pictures of the PostNL receipt as proof? Then I'll make the order ready for you"". So I did, I sent pictures of the receipt. Then the following evening (!!) the Facebook person replies. ""Sorry the item you requested is out of stock. Remember it's your responsibility that the wrongfully delivered item get's back to us in time. Only then can we refund the 207 euro's"". So your mistake is now my responsibility??It's not until now that I'm starting to get mad. I go home, and start another chat. With Conner this time. After a 65 min chat, he apologizes on behalf of his colleague. ""Pre packaging an item is not possible he says. You've been mislead by my colleague, I'm terribly sorry"". He promises to speed up the process of getting back the 207,- back to me. Since next week is my birthday and I now have no present and no refund back in time. It's going to take 5 to 10 working days he says. Still to late I say. He then gives me 20% discount promocode for my next order to compensate. I accept, thank politely and close the chat. Next morning, still so disappointed about that jacket I so desperately want. I go online, and to my surprise. Jacket is back in stock! I decide to take my chances and order the jacket again, using the 20% discount promocode dear Conner of customer care gave me. The promocode works. I go to check out. I try to pay. Oops, not enough money on my account. In my rush to score this jacket I forgot to put the cash from my savings to my paying account. I cancel the order and start over again. This time with enough balance on my account. So I go to check out. Insert the promocode again. It works. I pay. And all is good. Another 207,- euro's lighter, but at least I'm happy again. A few moments later I receive 2 emails. The first one says: The promocode you're using is invalid. Order cancelled. Second email says: Problem with bank. Order cancelled. I now check my bankaccount and see that 207 euro's in fact have been written of my account. With a big sigh I turn to that dreadful chat again. I explain the whole situation. That I have now paid 414 euro's for a jacket that I don't have. The girl on the chat is saying they have received no money from me and that the bank probably has it on hold. I ask the girl to hang on as I call the bank. Bank says, ""No the money has been wired to Asos. We're not holding it"". So I sent the girl a print screen of my bankaccount, with the full details of the transaction. Proving that I paid the damn jacket after all. She refuses to help me any further and offers me a discount of 10% the next time I order. She keeps on saying that another team needs to look into this. She even ends the chat while I'm still asking things. Now Asos, I need to know where that 414,- euro's went and if I'm ever going to get it back. And why are you doing so little to correct the mistakes that started with the wrongly delivered item, misleading a customer and now not looking into that strangely cancelled order. I have done everything you've asked me to do. So now it's time to correctly handle this complaint and show that you are a professional, adequate webshop that cares about their customers.

            I have been shopping online at asos for a few years now and I couldn't say one bad word about the company. I can rely on them for orders to be delivered on time and customer service is very helpful for any problems. Now they have included plus size clothing, I feel much better in myself for being able to wear more fashionable clothes that are available in my size, that isn't available elsewhere. I always get compliments on any item I wear from asos!

            i ordered a black full length dress on Tuesday evening for a black tie charity dinner on thursday night. i paid for next day delivery and received it very happy at 2pm the next day! however once trying it on i noticed there was a tear in the material on the side! not ideal for an event the next day!! so i hoped online to chat to one of the staff. Micheal took my order number then for a further 10 minutes didn't reply to me. he then proceeded to tell me my order didn't exist and then ended the conversation. as you can imagine i'm getting very stressed because at this stage ill be going stark naked to an event, i thought id try my luck again an hour later.. this time i spoke to Georgina! i explained my situation and then forwarded a photo of my previous conversation with the infamous Micheal. honestly Georgina could not have been more helpful she ordered my new dress straight away so it would be here (hopefully) in time for my event tomorrow night. whilst i wasnt that annoyed about the dress micheals attitude made it a whole lot worse- more people like georgina who were friendly, helpful and polite would be ideal!

            I just don't understand all those negative reviews. If you are not satisfied : Call or send an email to Asos Service! I am 100% satisfied by Asos' services & items. I have been ordering on their website for 5 years now. And I have never had an order lost or a long shipping. (It only lasts one week & I live in Belgium btw)   Or an item with deffect. I saw all the changement of this website : it gets better year by year. This year (for the first time) they forgot to put one little bandana choker in my order, I told them directly & they sent me my necklace. They resolved my problem quickly with a lot of kindness. And when I decide to return an item, I receive my money in 9 or 10 days only ! They always sell trendy clothes from their own brand (which is great quality) & from other brands. I love that now the return is free for Belgium. The last thing that they should improve : let people review & note items. They will certainly have less return if customers can help each other to buy an item. This is why I put 4 stars because I think that it's very important.  That's all. :) And I don't know why,  I'm skeptical by all those negative comments. Be careful, the concurrence is also here to destroy their image.

            I ordered a dress for a special occasion - I paid an additional $15 for express shipping with the understanding that there would not be any shipping or duty charges - based on what the website said.I received my order - on time - but was charged $35 COD for duty.  The dress didn't fit - again can't trust the website for sizing - now I have to pay $30 to ship the dress back.I've literally paid for the dress - twice - and can't wear it.

            Be very careful, I ordered 4 vests for ASOS, 3 were fine and one had a 4 inch gap down one seam where it had clearly missed the sowing machine during manufacturing. Contacted customer services, a few days later got an email asking for photos which I sent. Got another email saying they can't ope the images  (they were jpg the most widely used and readable images which means they could open them). I resent them and have had no response. A completely useless company who try to find any reason not to replace / refund items supplied not fit for purpose. Thankfully I pad with PayPal and will now contact them to get my money back. ASOS fine unless they send you faulty goods because you'll be stuck with them.

            Ordered some items. Delivery date came and went, no warning or apology it would be late. Email sent, no reply to ask when it may arrive....Follow up with online chat, agent left chat without answering the questions, as probably knew nothing would be happening and may be wanted to get her nails done or something productive! Follow up online chat, gave a ""way"" to complain, no reply! Follow up online chat, helpful agent realized after more than a month, we are not getting our product, even though asked me to check behind the bins one more time... But, at least they sent the refund...Refund arrives, not the right amount, back to online chat, another useless member of staff who cannot handle the simple request and then finished the chat, although they cleverly added some text to say if we do not need anything they will close the chat, hitting end instantly!! Crafty and useless, the staff and the company! Back to the online chat, requesting a complaint email, still not getting anywhere, told to follow the process already tried and then asked when did I last email... Not sure, but am sure you have a track of all this in customer data?!!? Now, the amount of money we didn't receive is small, yet why should we lose out for their inability to deliver goods? Why should they profit from not delivering goods? Customer service is suppose to appease a customer, to fix the issue, to leave the customer feeling the situation has been addressed and will be handled, not leaving you angry, annoyed and frustrated! To then not be able to speak to anyone but the account holder, even though they do not respond to that person... How on earth does that work? Long story short, take your business somewhere that cares and doesn't take you for granted!

            I have used ASOS for several years happily with no problems until recently. I ordered 2 items which I received the next day as I have premier delivery. Neither were any good, one I requested a refund the other I requested a replacement size. I returned the parcel via royal mail the same day I received the parcel. I never heard anything until I got a message from DPD stating I had a delivery due. I presumed it was my replacement size coat even tho I had had no email from ASOS stating they had received my return. The following day I got the coat. It was no good so I duly returned   it via royal mail. Meanwhile I had started chasing up my refund for the other item in the parcel. ASOS asked me for proof of my return! I stated it was in the parcel which they had already received with the coat in. It took 5 emails and 1 live chat to and 2 weeks to get my refund. In the meantime I never had an email regarding the returned replacement coat either. So I emailed them and attached a copy of the Post Office receipt. I was told I had to wait 21 days for them to receive the return. I emailed them back and said I live in the UK not abroad. They then said they would hand it over to their investigation team. That was weeks ago. I have heard nothing so as it is £85 I have asked my Credit card company to investigate for me and hopefully compensate. No longer will I use ASOS. Their customer service are incompetent, unable to read emails properly, make excuses saying your emails end up in spam boxes. I feel they have dodgy staff working for them in their returns department. Thorough checks need to be made - something needs to be done - sooner rather than later.

            I have ordered from Asos a couple of times before to the Netherlands and Slovakia without any issues however, since I have been in France it has been an absolute shi* show. My first order was sent back because I placed the house number at the end of the street name instead before it and the delivery man was  too much of an idiot to look. I have accepted this as my mistake although it took them 2 seconds to take my money and 3 weeks to return it. My second order was placed begining of October and I still dont have the package or my money back. The tracking said it  was delivered to my house while no one called me or brought the package. Asos told me to go looking behind bins or some other area the delivery boy could have left the package  or to try the post office. At the post office they told me the package was sent back however Asos did not have it. All I've gotten past month and a half is a bunch of sorrys but nothing done.. Horrifying service!

            I have had to stop buy-in on ASOS they are just awful to deal with. International customers beware as they refuse to do international exchanges, so if you buy something during a sale or with a promo code and want to change it for a different size, you have to go and repurchase it at full price! It's just not on and it's just bad business, to only offer exchanges to UK customers because it is more 'convenient' they told me - essentially they can't be bothered to put the time and money into making sure international customers have a good experience. They were so rude and just awful to deal with, frankly their words were just abhorrent.

            I've ordered numerous times from ASOS and all was fine until wndirect happened. I usually receive my ASOS packages earlier than the expected arrival date, but this time on the date of my arrival, there are no news of my package so I am getting quite anxious about it. The wnDirect's tracking service is really not helpful at all. The tracking rarely updates itself and even on the expected delivery date, which is today, it still says that my package is 'In Transit'. It doesn't even give me any location of where my package is at the moment, now how is that any good for a tracking service? The whole wnDirect website is very confusing to deal with, especially with how they do any 'tracking'. I sent emails to ASOS but after a whole day and half, no replies.I contacted ASOS on their live chat to enquire on the whereabouts of my package and the ASOS advisor ""Charles"" informed me, on the date of my expected arrival, that my package would be with me within 48 hours, again on the date of my expected arrival. I don't know whats up with ASOS but did Charles really expected me to wait 2 whole days, just sitting at home to wait for my package? So I asked Charles if he could give me the exact location of my package and exactly when would it come and he told me he cannot give me the location at the moment but he would ""get in touch with the courier to get an update and will e-mail me with the results within 48 hours"". Within 48 hours. What's the point Charles? What's the point in emailing me the results within 48 hours when you told me that my package would be with me within the next 48 hours. I want to know where is it now exactly!

I spent a lot of time placing an order for 14 Tops for my husband, took a lot of time going through them all with him, he doesn't like shopping, so he makes it quite a chore for me!  Anyways, i came back from my holidays in Uk to find i have received someone else's order.  It is a pair of white tennis shoes & a credit card holder the person's order number is 233508164 (just incase you are looking for your order).     Now this is not a problem  soi thought & i called customer service, that is..... after searching the internet for the number as it is not clearly written anywhere on the Asos website.  I spoke to a lovely customer service lady in Glasgow by the name of Chelsea who was very sweet , i know just doing her job.  She politely told me, nothing she can do, but refund me & all those tops now that i ordered weeks ago are out of stock!  I asked but what about the person who has my order or if my order gets sent back to you, she informed me there is nothing she can do about it.  How ridiculous is that?  You can't put a note in your system for when a wrong order turns up to hold it & send it on the rightful customer who spent her valuable time placing the order.   We purposely didn't buy my husband any clothes on our trip to London as we has placed this order online, now to no avail?    What kinda customer service is that?   I spent my valuable time placing an order & calling you to return some one else's order that i have received & yet you can't even spend the time to just make sure my orders gets to me?   The orders are tracked aren't they & delivered by courier?  It is more than likely then that the person who's order i have has mine right?   So why can't someone just pop the order number in the system & call the person who's order i have to see if they have mine & get it sent back to me, how is that so difficult?   By the way, nothing was mentioned to me either about what to do with this poor person's order that i have here too?   That's not very nice is it, i don't want someone else's order!!!!!!   Well i can't bothered dealing with this again , you have lost mine & my family's custom.  Why bother ordering with you when you can't even make sure it gets to me?  I understand accidents happen & people get sent wrong orders but at least do the right thing Asos & get the order eventually to the customer, it's not that hard.

            I'm not one to write a review on anything but ASOS customer service is so appalling I really had to warn others. If ever you encounter an issue when shopping with ASOS, do not expect it to be resolved quickly, politely, or at all. I have had several issues lately, from parcels not turning up yet being recorded as delivered when they are still sat in the hub, to student codes being rejected. I usually opt for 'chat with us' as a point of contact because if you email them a query you're growing old and grey before you get a response. But you just can't win, if you ask them something they can't answer they simply close down the chat without responding to your query. I have recently logged an issue about my student code not being accepted and had 3 chats closed down as they refuse to help. ASOS are just not worth the hassle anymore.

            They don't care about you. I paid premiership just to get express delivery. 2 of my orders were still processing after 4 days when it should have arrived. The customer service REP name FRANKIE is hopeless. His responses are all automated and not helping at all. Very disappointed with this service team. 1 of my orders never made it out of U.K., he didn't even check for me, I had to call DHL to find out instead.

            ASOS is pretty good. They dispatch things really fast (usually within 1 day) and the items are lightning quick delivery considering that it usually comes from the UK. They also offer expedited shipping for free over a certain amount. Sometimes stuff arrives quicker than when I buy from Australia.The quality of ASOS branded stuff is decent-- but it is very hit and miss. Some of it can be bad, but the same goes for a lot of places, like Target, etc. That said, occasionally there are bargains to be had, and they also carry branded stuff, and the quality is pretty great for that. They also sometimes carry hard to find items, and they often have good outlet sales. You have to be quick though, people pounce on their sales a lot.One thing that is bad is their exchange rate for Australia is pretty useless. You pay 20-70 dollars more on the Australian site for certain items, compared to GBP. They really need to fix this; other UK/Overseas retailers do not struggle with the exchange rate so much. Also, customer service (emails) can be really slow: It does take 3 days for them to reply. It used to be better, but I think that it is inundated now. They lost an order of mine recently, and I emailed them and it was taking so long for them to reply, that I went online and used their Chat service instead. On the plus side, their chat service is fantastic, I only waited about 10 minutes for a customer service rep, they looked into it immediately, fixed everything and re-sent my order within 1 day, and everything was sorted. In the meantime, the email inquiry actually received a reply 3 days later even though my order had been fixed up and re-sent. The dude was confused and told me that my order was fine and due to arrive the next day-- yes of course it was fine, now-- the chat rep had it re-shipped two days earlier for me because it had been lost.So I mean, I wasn't upset, but they really really need a ticketing system, whereby your query generates a ticket and when it is resolved, they close the ticket. There was no way for me to 'cancel' my email inquiry, and them responding to it was literally double handling and wasting time they could have used to help someone else. That said, they were very nice, but they need a better system.That said, their free returns are fantastic and are the main reason why I have been using them more, and I think they are pretty great. Not many places offer free returns-- especially not on change of mind returns-- and these are hassle free and fast. They do take a while to go back into your account, though, but that's understandable.All in all, don't be dissuaded from bad reviews and give it a try. If you are super impatient then perhaps don't bother, but in my experience they do try their best to fix any issues that occur, even if it takes them a long while.

            Look, things happen when it comes to online shopping. Shipping can get messed up and deliveries can go missing. But this is something any online business must prepare for, and how they handle it after the fact is what separates good customer service from bad. ASOS is on the very bad side of that spectrum. They claim to be a 24 hours a day 7 days a week customer service. I sent an email, and did not get a response for 80 hours. Thats 3+ days. On top of that, the email gave me non helpful advice. Check the post office, check your neighbors, search your driveway all over. I think 3 days was enough time for me to do that. But ok, youre covering the bases and its holiday season, so ill let it go. I respond within an hour of their email telling them ive done everything they suggested and that i want to know what the next steps are. 8 hours later, no response. So i get on an online live chat and the guy helps me get a re order, says it will take up to 24 hours to process. 25 hours later, no email, no notice of my order update. So i connect yet again on messenger only to be told that my order was refunded because they were out of stock. I checked my spam/junk email. No notice of this even happening. So i was just supposed to guess, i guess? Very disappointing, because this was a gift that my S/O and i were excited about. Now we will never buy from ASOS again. A worker there may say good riddance, but what happened to the business practice, that it is unacceptable to lose a customer for something within your control as a business. Ill reiterate. Im fine that the product didnt arrive and that the process had a mixup. Im not fine with how it was handled after the fact, and the amount of effort I had to go through to get answers/compensation.Jake Balderama

            Have been using ASOS for years - delivery has always been terrible but I made peace because it was free. I was in a rush for an item which was to be with me no later than the Monday - when I tracked it it was still sitting at the hub. I disputed only to receive my reply 8 days later. When my parcel arrived the items packaging was labelled correctly but the label on the waistband was 2 sizes too small. Still waiting on my replacement. I was continually ignored. Really disappointed.

            I've been a loyal customer for years; wide range of clothing styles, from a range of brands, all in one place which offers free UK delivery and free returns - what's not to love? Only recently they've been slipping on quality and customer service. I've had a number of their own brand items arrive with faulty seams or wonky zips, which doesn't usually bother me as they're normally only cheap any way and the kind of fault half an hour with a sewing kit will fix. However, I just recently bought a dress for a funeral for £42 where the zip totally jammed while I was trying it on, and the only way to get out was to break the zip. I messaged asos through Facebook to look into their policy for exchange/refund of the item in this condition and after 3 messages back I'm still none the wiser! Each person manning their Facebook says something different! One says I can exchange (even though I explained this was not possible in the time frame), another says I might get a refund, and the last says simply to return it and see what happens. Only because I need the dress relatively soon am I ordering a replacement, very interested to see how they eventually do handle the broken dress though.

            I've been having a poor customer service experience that's dragged on for a couple days. Money was taken from my bank account (via PayPal) for items that I attempted to purchase. Then I received an email saying ""We're really sorry, but we were unable to complete your order as your Paypal payment failed."" Only.... you do actually have my $75.50, and I have no merchandise. Your terrible ""Chat with us"" feature on your site connects me to individuals who clearly do not have access to your bank records. Then, when I explain everything fully, they reply with the same stock answers. I've spoken to 4 different chat specialists, all of whom were unhelpful. I'm at a loss. This was a terrible experience. Then, after messaging with 3 or 4 employees on ASOS's facebook response team... I wound up getting an offer for 10% off my next order... which would be 5% MORE than I was paying in the first place, as the items had returned to full price. the 2 pack now cost $52 and the joggers are now $43seriously. ASOS knows how to run a scam on it's clients.I'd have to pay $95 (which is $85.50 with your measly discount) vs the $75.50 I would paid 2 days ago.You expect me to pay $10 more.... after the crummy service experience?

            I was about to order a playsuit from a different company and went in here to see all the reviews. Which were really bad. So as a curiosity, I have typed ASOS as most of my clothing actually from this company, just to compare... I was very chocked to see all these bad reviews. So I though I would write about my experience with the online shopping. I LOVE ASOS, I will say 80% of my cloths are from there. *** COMMUNICATIONGreat communications. Any problems I ever had, I always had someone at the other end getting back to me promptly. Don't get me wrong I have experienced some problems, but nothing too major. Put it that way, I had far more good experiences than bad ones.*** REFUNDSuper easy to send back. You can either drop it off at the post office or at a collect + point. And I usually got the money within the time frame said on the website. Never had a single problem with that. Once I bough a pair of hearings, which broke within few days. They send me a new pair, no questions asked.*** Problems or delayObviously there are no perfect companies, and mistake happens. When it does happen (late delivery, wrong items) I am awarded with apology and have a 10% discount straight away.In 7 years, a late delivery happened once. Wrong item happened once too.I got to know my body quite well pretty much thanks for shopping at ASOS so many times that I know what would fit me or not. But usually what you see is what you get.I love shopping with ASOS. They are quite prompt to answer, GREAT products. The only bad thing is the cloth are not the cheapest. However, you get the occasional discount.  But because I am addicted, I can't look away. Few years ago, around christmas they had 40% on everything, I had a field day.I am a very happy customers since 2009. Don't be put off by all the bad reviews. I am sure they are valid, but if I never had dealt with ASOS and I went in here to find out more I would have walked away, that is why I though writing a genuine review would set the record straight. Any way happy shopping !!

            I ordered in good faith of receiving my item on time. Almost 2 weeks later and after various emails and twitter DM's, often repeating what I had said already, no help was actually given apart from what I already knew. One advisor even said that it had been delayed because my address has changed - I've lived at the same address my whole life. It eventually turns up, on my door step!!! Not happy, and ASOS don't seem to care - yes, they refunded my delivery charge, but only after I asked for it back! Not even a discount offered for such a shambles of a service. This was the second time out of three orders that didn't arrive on time. Never again.

            I placed an order online which I extended to over £100 to get free next day delivery. I was later informed that my order had been delayed. As I am away and need it for this week I asked if it can be sent to another collection point instead of my address. The customer advisor supposedly assisting was awful, made no attempt to find out what's going on and could not cancel the order either. I've also checked with dpd tracking and it states the order has not been received yet I'm being told to contact dpd myself therefore the parcel is still with ASOS. I was also suggested to wait at home incase they do deliver...however the messages state my order will not be delivered today and the 'advisor' states it may be delivered today?! Get your story straight!!!! Stop wasting my time!!! The advisor also was very rude and unhelpful and was very keen to end the chat stating that s/he has answered my questions. I asked for his/her name so I can make a complaint to the head of the department but I was repeatedly told 'I am the complaints department'. The attitude alone says a lot about your staff and company.ASOS do something about it! Look at the ratings and majority of reviews, you may be an online business but if you don't understand what customer service is then why are you in this business???!!!!

            I've ordered from Asos numerous times but this latest time was a disaster. Firstly I will say that under normal circumstances I fully understand that once orders are processed that they can't offer refunds. However, considering the huge email confirmation and order history errors over this weekend (12/11) I would have expected there would be some leniency. As others have done after viewing their Twitter feed, I placed an order but didn't receive any confirmation via email or on site so I placed it again. This was a large one off order of over £200 so to be charged twice at nearly £450 is going to have an impact on my bank account. Asos live chat informed me that banners were displayed all over the site but over the tablet and mobile site there was not one mention of any technical errors they were experiencing. It was only after placing my order I went to the help section that I spotted these ""banners all over the site"". As someone who works with ecommerce sites I was quite surprised to learn that the 'help' section was ""all over the site"". Their live chat service, customer rep Zoya was adamant that this was all over the site however.

            About half the things that i've ever ordered have looked somewhat like they do on the website and haven't been of bad quality. This is not great news since the delivery and returns are atrocious. Decided to only ever buy accessories and items that aren't clothing so i wouldn't risk it not fitting me and having to send it back and never get any money back. But now i've received a double order and have been billed twice so have to send things back anyway. Customer service claims i ordered the same things twice, but i wasn't shopping whilst drunk so i don't see how that could have happened without me noticing. Never asos again.

            ASOS make it so difficult to get in contact if you have any problems with ordering / their website / delivery etc. When you do finally get through to the online chat they are really slow to reply, extremely unhelpful and just leave the chat if they can't help.

            Asos have no idea what good service is. When you complain in the chat function on the website, they just close the chat if the dont want to answer. They send me a wrong size first, then they send a replacement, but didn't put the correct adress on it, so it was returned to sender. Then when i contact them about it, they say they will send me the refund once the parcel has arrived back and from there it will take 7-10 days for me to get the money back. How is it that i am the one getting punished when the mistake was made be Them? Twice even!! And then they try an put on me by saying that they have put the adress i have on my profile, but my local postal service that had to return it to sender, have proof that they in fact didn't put that adress on it. They just tell you sorry and that i can purchase a new one. Like i am going to do that when they have both my money and my item! The least they could do was to give some sort of discount as a way to say sorry for everything. Everyone i know who had been shopping on ASOS has had trouble with them, and they keep on saying that they can assure me that this doesn't happen often.

            I made an order with ASOS, ended up purchasing a couple bathing suits. I am beyond disappointed with my purchase. My order was suppose to arrive on November 2nd, and by November 4 it still wasn't here so I emailed the company asking where it was. They told me to wait until November 19. I was very upset with this because I only ordered with them because customer service said it would arrive before I leave for my vacation. And if it arrived on the 19 that was after I left. I expressed my problem with this and the woman basically told me that it's unfortunate but nothing she can do. So I requested a refund. She told me to KEEP the bathing suits for my next vacation, and before I had a chance to respond she ended the chat. I was very upset but decided to let it go because there was still a chance it would get here before my vacation. Today, November 10th I finally received my package. My package had 47$ worth of duty fees. I understand that this isn't entirely ASOS fault, however the delivery company based their % of duty on the weight of the package. The package had a couple light bathing suits in it. But somehow the package weighed a hefty amount due to unneccessary wrapping. I will never be ordering from their company again and have already advised all my friends to steer clear as well.

I today am reviewing after they did the exact same thing!! But not only have they taken payment twice, they have taken it a third time!! And similar to the last time, I'm told to wait up to 10 days for it to be refunded again. Customer Service refuse to put you through to a manager to discuss further, refuse to provide you with Head Offices details (despite them being freely available online!?), refuse to guarantee a call back from any manager and have less empathy than a peanut! Disgusting service and absolutely shocked this can happen again.

            I bought two items and one did not fit so I returned it through their collect plus for the curiour to come and collect it. It was collected on 19 October, so after two weeks (last week) I've checked my bank and no refund was issued so I contacted the customer service. They said 72 hours to investigate so I gave them the order number and postage barcode again. It's been a week now and they still have not update me despite contacting them twice after that and all I'm getting from them is they will get back to me as soon as they can. They are very frustrating! Once I get my refund I will never go on that Asos website again!

            I returned 5 items in the same bag using Collect Plus.  I emailed to enquire why I had not been refunded the correct amount giving the order number, payment details, copy return receipt and copy delivery note but didn't realise that the original order had been placed from my daughters email address.  Customer Services would not communicate with me at all unless I emailed from the same email address from which I placed the order.  This I did again providing all the above and have been advised that I should have used an insured return method even though the Asos website advises Collect Plus as an option.  However, the method of return and whether it is insured should make no difference as the bag was obviously received by Asos as I received a partial refund which they advise me is for 2 of the items.  I am getting the impression that they will try any method to avoid having to make a refund regardless of fault or responsibility.  Do not use this company.  They have no integrity.

            I've been ordering from ASOS for about 3 years and regularly too (I'd say at least an order every 2 weeks) and have never had any problems until now.I ordered on there Halloween 20% off day all was going great until a few hours later I got an email from ASOS to say my PayPal transaction was  unsuccessful. I checked my bank account and all was well so thought it must be just a glitch and my money wouldn't leave the account, I was wrong. A few days later the money left my account and I immediately contacted ASOS who said that my funds were just pending I repeatedly reassured them they weren't pending they had left my account and I did this via email via instant chat and via twitter and got the same (word for word same) reply each time, my funds were pending and PayPal would release them in 5 days. They would not believe my money had been taken and instead said I was 'mistaken' so I opened a dispute on PayPal who investigated it and I got a full refund. If it wasn't for PayPal I would've never got my money back as they would not believe they even took it, when I sent bank statements to them they still refused to accept they had taken the money and had had it for over a week. Awful service, will never again be using ASOS.

            ASOS was having its 20% off sale so I decided to splurge on a new winter coat. BAD IDEA. It arrived suspiciously early and when I came back from my work trip to find the package, it looked way too small to have a jacket inside. It was a thin, hooded sweatshirt in a completely wrong size. I immediately sent ASOS a incorrect item email only to not hear from them for several days. I sent them another email a few days later and contacted customer care through their chat service. The company finally responded but had waited until my item was out of stock when they tried to make the replacement. So now they won't make the replacement at all. I'm getting refunded but if I want to buy the jacket again, it'll have to be in a size too big with no discount. I'm very disappointed in their service and will only buy cheap items, if anything at all, from now on.

            I shop here a lot and it really bothers me that their customer service is so horrible. They wont honor price adjustments, even when an order was placed a day before and now everything I ordered is on sale 20%. They want me to order another order and return the old order. Isnt that more work for you? Just honor the adjustment and you will have less work, and you will have angered me WAY less. They remove all discounts on the whole order if you return just a part of the order. When you pressure them by saying that this is bad business practice as every other competitor of theirs honors price adjustments, and doesnt just screw their customers out of discounts - they just say ""sorry"". I mean, take some hints from amazon - they have amazing customer service and sometimes take the financial fall for customers, but in return, you have incredible customer loyalty. It is hard to be loyal to ASOS when they plainly take your money and run.

I start to chat with asos costumer service. They asked my order number, but I don't have one because I'm still waiting for my conformation email. My order doesn't exist. So I asked my money back. She said there were IT problems and I had to talk to my bank because my bank was holding back my money. Later in the conversation she said there weren't any IT of tech problems. Than she closed the conversation.I contacted my bank, they say ASOS is holding back my money, so it's up to ASOS to give me my money back.With this outcome I started an other chat. She said again there were IT problems. And it will take 5 to 10 workdays to give me my money back. So I'm still waiting....This was my first and last time I will ever buy something from ASOS.

            Living in Asia, I placed an order expecting long delivery lead time. Indeed, ASOS emailed me on despatch date and estimated delivery lead time to 20 days or less. For 29 days, I received absolutely no notification, neither by email nor by phone, until I got an automated email stating my home address was incorrect (although it wasn't). It was impossible to track my order from ASOS website. It's been more than a month, and I still have no idea  where my order is or whether I can get a refund. After days of looking for a direct customer services phone number or email address, I sent an message yesterday through ASOS website and still haven't heard from them. Such incompetency is appalling!

            This company literally couldn't care less about you as a customer.I placed 4 orders within 5 days of each other, 3 of them didn't turn up next day even though I pay yearly for this. Whenever I contacted them they just told me to wait and promised me that they would contact me within 48 hours which never happened. Whilst using live chat I told them I was fed up and just wanted a refund for the amount I paid for the next day delivery, and they literally said no and then ended the chat within a second, not leaving me any chance to reply. This is the equivalent of hanging the phone up on a customer in my opinion which we would get fired for at my place of work.Absolutely appalled and left with no choices here. Looking at the rest of the Trustpilot feedback they clearly don't care and probably won't even read this.

            Been having some issues regarding a refund. None of the three people I've tried to contact in the chat has given me answer, in spite of the fact that I've rephrased the question several times - they are completely vague, and in the end, they simply close the chat. Pretty unacceptable, especially since my issue is mainly their own lack of clarity.Backstory: I bought a bag and a blouse well over a month ago. I soon realised that the item was sent to the wrong address, so I wrote to ASOS that I wanted the item returned and a refund - then I'd buy the same items again immediately. ASOS told me: no can do. I'd have to wait 'till they received the item from DPD again, and then I'd wait up to 14 days for a refund. I pressed on, but the guy in the chat told me that those were the rules. So I accepted. Yet I later read that this is wrong! According to what I have read,(it was on the Internet, so I'd take it with a grain of salt) ASOS is supposed to give me a refund within 7 working days as soon as they order the item back from the courier - they shouldn't demand to receive the item at first. Unfortunately I lost the query number for this interaction.Current issue:Well, I ordered the items yet again and waited patiently for a refund. And I got one, though only for one of the two items(the bag; the blouse was not even listed as received in their confirmation mail, even though they were sent in the same bag). I reported this, and an investigation was apparently started around oct. 4th, yet I never heard from them. When I wrote again, they simply told me they needed to 'start fresh' on ANOTHER investigation.They told me that I needed to wait 48 hours yet again, then they'd report back on what the courier had to say. I asked them ""Well, what if the courier doesn't know what happened to the item, and the issue cannot be resolved? Will I get my money back, then?"". And they simply refuse to answer. Twice now they've closed the chat, and just flat-out ignore me on Facebook. I don't know exactly what to do, as I have no idea what my rights regarding this is. ASOS apparently can't inform me on this simple issue, so it's one star from me.

Dpd can't change delivery address they tell me asos have to, I phone asos explain I'm nearly2 weeks in after waiting on a delivery I need it by Friday I selected express delivery but they have made an error with the delivery address. I was told they would not be changing the delivery address and the best that could happen was a refund which could take 12days to process! The wedding is this Saturday and to be completely honest even though I find it a bit of a nuisance that they won't just change the delivery address after confirming who you are (and dpd telling me they have done it previously for customers) I probably would not have left a negative review if the customer service hadn't been so poor! The women was clearly irritated at dealing with me and my questioning why they don't change delivery addresses. I was spoken to rudely and she clearly had no sympathy I genuinely won't shop here again and I used to love asos (even got my maternity wear from them) but it feels like a kick in the teeth to be spoken to like that as a loyal customer.

            Placed an order. No confirmation mail. No actual help, just the following response: bare with us and wait 10 days. If you don't get a confirmation on the order or your money, contact us again............... What the actual ^&*#. That is no customer service. That is ignoring the problem and not caring for the customer.I just lost 330 euro's for about a month, if not longer. This is the second time this has happend! The last time I spend more then a month emailing back and forward before something happend. I don't want to spend the time or energy convincing someone I placed an order and feeling like an idiot. Because that's how you get treated if there is a problem.

            I just would like the customer service representative to do a simple check if the dress had a plain bottom brief under the skirt, just like its bodice version. The customer representative simply replied, ""order it and return after you dislike it."" Come on! There are people who live in countries which has no free returns and have to pay the shipping of an item. Wouldn't it be better that the customer representative do the check and I buy it and done? Whats the point of a customer sales representative then? As an online store, customers aren't able to physically see and know the product as well as in-store purchases. Obviously, as an customer sales representative for an online store, there are more duties to be done. What is the point of a customer/sales representative if they are of no help to the customers!?!Just so to be clear, I gave 1 star solely for its customer service. The 1 star does not reflect any other qualities like clothing quality, shipping quality etc.

            I've bought from ASOS in the past, and never had a problem. This time however, I only bought one item, and I never received it. When I inquired as to where it was, they were incredibly unhelpful telling me to wait a month to see if it would arrive, or that I could just order a new one, and return the other when (or if) it arrives. Like, what? No. Working in retail, customer service is very important to me. They eventually gave me a refund, but their shipping company is obviously in need of a reprimanding.

            I've been a loyal customer of ASOS for at least five years now, and I usually place an order at least once a month if not more. Their delivery and returns service is unlike any other I've came across, it's so quick and truly unbeaten by any other retailers in my opinion. They always have ample choice and something for every price range. I was really surprised to see the amount of negative reviews on here. The few times I've ever had an issue with my order, it was promptly taken care of to my satisfaction by the customer care team. I would highly recommend ASOS, and it will continue to be my first choice for online shopping!

            I'm looking at all these negative comments about ASOS and their customer service but I've never had any issue with them. Well, except that I can't track most of my orders. I've probably ordered from ASOS 20+ times already. Always quite happy with my shopping experience with them. One time they shipped a shirt that was mislabelled as a pair of gloves. I'm not sure how that mistake occurred but ASOS took care of it right away. They expedited my gloves to me and took full responsibility for the mistake. If you communicate with their customer service via Twitter, they're always more than willing to help you out and communicate quite quickly. I will continue to shop at ASOS. I have been for the last four or so years.

            I've been online shopping for years, and I have officially encountered the worst customer service--with ASOS. I ordered a dress and they delivered the WRONG dress. When I communicated with them via online chat, I agreed in getting a replacement instead of a refund. I was told that I would receive the correct dress in 3 days. Now, over a week later, I still have not received the dress! When I communicated them via online chat, they told me they JUST placed the order. Over a week after they told me it would arrive, they had barely placed the order! And they said all they could do was apologize. They NEVER made up for their mistake in ANY WAY. Not for sending the wrong dress, and not for lying about the delivery date! I bought this as a bridesmaid dress, and now I'm afraid I won't get the dress on time for the wedding, but everyone else has already gotten the same dress so I have no choice but to wait! And they couldn't even promise fast shipping to atone for THEIR mistake! Stay away from ASOS!

            I had a terrible shopping experience on Asos.com on 10/17 and 10/18.On 10/17 I placed a order for $222.56. I purchased 2-day shipping for a year. I used a promotion code I received which gave me 15% off my order. I did not receive as confirmation email. On 10/18, I logged into my Asos.com account and saw the order was now in status: ""Order Unsuccessful""I used your online chat to speak to an agent named Conor.Conor informed my that the reason my order was unsuccessful was because my card was declined.1. My credit card was not declined. I called my bank and confirmed with them you removed the money form my account and then put it back. 2. You did not notify me that my order was cancelled. I had to reach out to find out what was going on.3. Conor was very rude and not apologetic. He logged out without thanking me for my time or saying goodbye.On 10/18, I attempted to redo my order. I was very sad to see the dress I purchased for my best friends wedding was sold out in my size I ordered it in a different size to see if it would fit. I applied the same promo to my order. My promo code was denied for reason: ""You've already used this promo code""I once again reached out via your online chat.I was told that an advanced specialist would need to look into my issue with the promo code which could take 24-48 hours. They refused to give me a new promo code to use. I don't have 24-48 hours because I'm worried the other dresses will sell out. I placed the order at full price. I did not buy 2-day shipping, this time I used EXPRESSUSA for shipping.I was told that once I purchased it, there will be nothing you can do about the money.The way I see it, I am owed a 15% discount. You also need feedback to improve your buying system. I should not be responsible with tracking down what happened to my order. My credit card was NOT declined so I don't know why it's saying it is in your system. Something is broken or someone is wrong. It shouldn't take 12 hours for me to find out that my card was declined. I lost out on a dress I wanted to wear because of this situation.

            I recently ordered some new clothes from ASOS. They were apparently delivered today. Where they were delivered I do not know, the delivery company wont speak to me. After contacting ASOS for assistance, they could not find any trace of my account or order, despite taking my money! They have now just ended a call with me because they could not find my details and told me Technical would email me in due course once they found the details. How long will this take? Where is my order? How can you take my money if you have no trace of my account or order? Useless, never again!

            After ordering and paying £9.95 for ASOS Premier delivery my item did not arrive the next day. But the day after it should have arrived my tracking suddenly changed to received. Having contacted ASOS over this I was told to 'check my address was correct' and 'see if it has been left with any neighbours' despite there being people in when my order was supposedly delivered and no card out through the door. ASOS customer services promise to get back in touch with you but they do not. I had to messaged them five times over a week just to find out what they are doing about this issue. After messaging them again today a week after I placed the order they once again said they will look into it and get back to me. I then get another email stating that they are sorry but they are unable to locate my order, and that they had refunded the item since it is now out of stock. So I've payed for premier delivery which is beyond pointless since I don't receive my orders because they choose to deliver through Hermes which as most people know is an awful delivery service as drivers often 'lose' packages which is ironic considering they said they had delivered mine.

            I've shopped with ASOS for years and made the mistake of paying for premier shipping, a product that is *meant* to give me free express shipping and returns. Well, ASOS failed to send a single order via express and when I tried to address the issue, claimed all sorts of nonsense including flat out lying and saying I had received it when I hadn't, and they're refusing to refund me. I guess scamming a customer out of $40 is more important than not screwing them over and having them continue shopping with ASOS for years to come. ASOS customer service are rude incompetent, and refuse to address the numerous problems that come with their products. Avoid like the plague

            I placed an order with ASOS back in September 2016. My order was for Adidas T-shirt and Adidas leggings.  It is important to note that I have been in an ASOS customer for over five years, with no issues and have always been pleased. Back to this particular order, I received the order and when I opened it,  I was horrified to find that there were bugs inside of my packaging. Now in a state of shock, I disposed of the items  and went straight to Google for a customer service number. It is also important to note that in my five years of being a customer I have never had to call their phone number, so I was unaware that they only resolve issues via email or chat.  When I reached out to a customer service representative, I was assured  that a team member would be responding to me within 48 hours. Within the 48 hours I was notified that my account had been closed and they were not able to disclose the information as to why. I am extremely  disappointed in the lack of customer service I received and the way my item was shipped to me. It was as if they wanted me to take the blame for the issues and my items. Now, I am out of almost $100 because they will not refund me for the item and I can no longer purchase anything from the site for a reason unbenounced to me.

My package got lost in the mail so I contacted UPS who told me that it was lost and to get Asos to refund me or resend the items. Upon reaching out to Asos they told me to contact UPS...I was responding back and forth and they accused me of putting the wrong address (which I had gotten packages shipped to before and was stored in their system). Every response said let me check into it and they would take days to get back...all automated messages. I even got the same message twice!!!

It's just not true and it makes figuring out your own size impossible.  Unless you're clairvoyant, expect to need to return things often.***They say ""free returns"" but somehow they don't know if you return something to them until you remind them that they owe you money.They don't reply to customer care emails unless you threaten to dispute credit charges.They lie and tell you that refunds are coming.You will never speak to the same customer service rep via email because every email they send has a different ridiculous fake name.I've received replies from 4 names (that I can remember) since mid September.  Notice the theme among other reviews of Asos telling you to wait longer and longer for your money.  Not only do I regret my purchase, I regret sending the item back for no reason.  I feel like I just gave them free money.If you try to reach them on social media, they block you, lie, and tell you to message them privately.  They don't answer private messages, they just do that to save face.  They essentially mute you and pretend that they're doing the right thing.The clothing is less than average quality in Europe-  they get by by keeping nice looking items in low supply and presenting them to American consumers at a jacked up price.Save yourself the headache.

            they have no phone number associated with the company where you can call.  second they make it very difficult to return the items.  watch out for the label tracking number.  the tracking number on the label provided is NOT for USPS it is their own tracking system.  the customer service reps are clueless when it comes to returns.  apparently they take 11 days to return a simple merchandise.  I would simply just order from Amazon, it is so much easier.  the customer service reps should at least know when the items were received and they act as if they have no idea when the shipment was returned.  they take apparently 11 days to return the items and then take another few days to process the credit cards.

            This past summer I ordered a swimsuit for when I go on vacation. It was a really nice swimsuit with a mesh top and high waisted bottoms I was really excited to get it. I had ordered it with standard business shipping, it came on time,but the problem was that the top was the wrong size. I proceeded to contact asos customer service by sending them an e-mail, I waited for 2 days but still no reply. After the 2 days I sent them another e-mail and waited another 2 days still no reply. So I saw online saying that you can contact them through twitter so I did that. Within the next day someone replied,  I told them I would be going on vacation in less than 4 days so I would like get the swim top asap. So the order was processed and I received my swimsuit top and within two days. Unfortunately again they sent me the wrong size as well as the top was a completely different from what I ordered. By that time it was too late to order another top, because I have to go on vacation. After I came back from vacation I sent both tops and bottom back for refund. I was told to wait a 5 to 10 business days for a refund,and I would receive an email from the warehouse thing that a package was received. I returned the products on August 24th and received partial refund on September 1st for the bikini bottoms and not the top. So I contacted Asos and told them the situation about me receiving only partial refund. I was told once again that I would have to wait 7 for returns to process. I was confused as to why I received half every fund if both products were inside the same package. So I contacted them and they said that my they would look into it. They said that my replacement didn't reach your house yet and that I had to wait until September 8th and then contact them again. So I contacted them on September 9th and because I still didn't receive my full refund. They said they would have their Specialist Team look into the problem andvwait another 48 hours. The problem was finally resolved and I finally received my refund 15 days later. I never had a problems with ASOS before, but after this experince I definitely won't be buying any products from them anytime soon.

            I bought a lovely dress for my prom, received it quickly and in good shape. But I noticed that the top part of my dress and also sleeves (all made of lace) was made of a different kind of lace than the one they showed on their website. The ""edge"" of the sleeves were also ""cut"" differently than on the website pictures. I'm not a picky person and still liked the dress, but it was clear to see the difference between my dress and the pictures on the website. So I took a picture of me in my dress. In a collage, I put my picture next to ASOS' picture, so it was clear to see the difference between what the website was claiming to sell and what I'd actually received. This I sent to the ASOS customer service. I got a message back, about a week later, telling me that they couldn't see any difference. Bull...Sadly trustpilot won't allow me to link the collage I made, but the difference was clear! So watch out for what you order - your product might not look exactly like the one online! Scam.

            It's taken me a while to feel good about ASOS after an experience where I returned an item and didn't get a refund. As I had an urgent event on Friday, I ordered some options from ASOS on Thursday and picked overnight delivery. I took the day off (I'm paid by the hour so I lost a days pay) to wait as it was important. I got a text with a one hour window from DPD. At that time, I got another saying that I had rescheduled my delivery - which I hadn't. Apparently it went to my old address. Whether this was my doing or ASOS is uncertain as I changed my address beforehand using my phone. I can't entirely blame ASOS for that. So I spent an hour on the phone to DPD (30 mins waiting) and simultaneously chatted to ASOS (Vanessa) as there was no phone number. DPD were v. helpful. They said that I had to ask ASOS to call them and change address and they could re-deliver to my new address the next day. I was panicked but rescheduled my event to the next evening Saturday. BUT ASOS chat said that none of this was possible even though DPD were on the phone saying it was possible. ASOS chat refused to call DPD. I insisted she give me a phone number. She refused and said there was no number. I was livid. DPD were great & gave me a number for ASOS. I called and another hour later, Kirsty at customer services agreed to call DPD and arrange a delivery for next day so I could have the items for my event. I double checked she had my new address. She then called me back and said it wasn't possible. DPD wouldn't deliver to my new address as a change of address as it was the first time to there. Instead she said she would have them send to a DPD pick up point near me for Saturday, but only after 12pm. I agreed as I was desperate. I asked if I could pick one near to me. She said no, she would do that on google maps and find the nearest and send me an email confirming all the details. She did this. I received the email but the pick up point, a pharmacy/newsagent, was no where near me but on the other side of town. 20 mins if no traffic, 30 mins in bad traffic. I was so tired of it all that I accepted that. The email told me to wait until I had received confirmation it had arrived around 12pm before going to collect. Sure enough at 12.07pm I got an email saying my package was ready for collection. I jumped in the car and drove to the pick up. When I got there it was closed!!!! What?????? I asked the dentist next door what time the pick up point had shut and they said that it had closed at 12.30pm and wasn't open on Sundays but would open again on Monday. So, let's get this straight? They delivered my urgent package to a pick up point, 20 mins before it closed for the entire weekend and I live (and Kirsty was using google maps) at least 20 mins away (make that 30 mins on a Saturday). I basically had NO CHANCE of getting there. Right. I called and they offered me another 10% discount. No thank you. That would be an insult. I then said, look, let me pay again and get the goods delivered on Sunday or Monday to my house. She said, what a good idea. Only thing is, the items you ordered are now out of stock. You ordered the last. Give me a break! I took a whole day off on Friday. I spent 2 hours on the phone. I drove there on Saturday (2 hours) and now I have to take time off on Monday to go and pick it up again. When I looked online there is a pick up 5 mins from my house, open until 7pm and on Sundays.I hate your company. I hope everyone finds out what a shabby service you offer. I hope the competition edge you out of the market. What a load of inconvenience and misery you cause people.

            I ordered pajamas and slippers from there and I always track my packages online. I was given a four day delivery, it ended up getting here 5 days late. So, four days passed, no package, 5 days past again, no package. I finally get my items and it's all just wrong. I ordered a tall pajamas and I must've gotten short because they were so incredibly small. I'm not giant enough that I don't fit into normal people's clothing either. Instead of sending me tall specified product they sent me one for not normal height people, but shorter people. I also ordered slippers. The sippers were 5/6 when I ordered 7/8. I was disappointed but not extremely let down because my feet can still fit in 5/6 because i'm size 6-6 1/2 it's just not as comfortable. Well, my little remaining hope of satisfaction was shredded yesterday when my slippers ripped. Not even a month of having them, probably wearing them all of 5 times, the fabric has come apart. The worst part is that this wasn't cheap stuff. It was over 40.00. I have been trying to communicate with customer service but if their customer service operates like their shipping and delivering and quality control I'm probably going to be stuck with wasted money and crappy quality clothes and broken slippers. DO NOT SHOP HERE. Just go to Target.

            Let me start this review by saying that I have ordered from ASOS countless times in the past and have rarely had a problem. When I have had an issue such as an item missing, they've quickly resolved it.However, recently I have noticed that their ""next day delivery"" service is nothing of the sort. I have placed several orders before the cut-off time and yet they have not been delivered the next day.Most recently, I placed an order on a Tuesday evening and it was not in fact delivered until the Friday, with no explanation. Then, I discovered that 3 of my 6 items were missing from the parcel. The parcel had been clearly opened and resealed with DPD tape, so I was willing to let this go as an issue with the delivery company rather than ASOS.However, my experience trying to resolve the issue with the missing items has been catastrophic. When reporting the missing items via the ASOS website, you can only report one item at a time so I had to send three separate emails and I got three separate replies detailing what to do. I thought the best thing to do would be to copy and paste these responses into one email, explain what had happened and send this to ASOS customer care.Now, one person handling one of the missing items immediately sent the item out, whereas the other two hesitated and asked for more info. By the time I had received a reply saying they were looking into the issue with DPD delivery (and would reply within 48 hours), I knew the two remaining items wouldn't arrive before I moved away for uni, so I clearly requested to be refunded for these two items. In my next reply from ASOS I was told I had been refunded for one of the items, but there was no mention of the other.I politely replied saying I still needed a refund for the final item, and 24 hours later received a reply from ASOS saying they'd have to pass this issue onto the specialist team and they would get back to me within 48 hours, despite the fact that this issue has already been fully investigated. I have now replied detailing this and expressing that I require a refund immediately.It has now been 10 days since I placed my order and a week since I started my complaints and my issues have still not been fully resolved, resulting in a delay in having the money returned to my account.I have now realised that the issue with the customer service is that every time you email them, a different person replies so there isn't one person handling your problem: it's being passed around the department. For a problem as complex as mine has become, this is making it near impossible for it to be solved. In the future I will seriously hesitate before ordering anything from ASOS again. This experience has dragged on for far too long and left me infuriated and around £100 out of pocket.

            I've generally never had much of an issue with ASOS before, sometimes sizes are a bit bigger than expected but such is life. However I ordered a red military style jacket which arrived baby pink. Upon trying to find some answers from customer service, they told me it was just the lighting in which the jacket was being viewed. Now I don't know what what lighting they use but it must be a miracle to turn baby pink into red. Made to feel like I was an idiot, not impressed ASOS.

            Here's the thing about ASOS, even if it is their fault if you don't get the correct order, even if you order something and you NEVER receive it, they DON'T OFFER YOU A COUPON FOR A FUTURE ORDER. Like why should I even have to ask for one? I've had two issues with them within the past year. The first incident I ordered a purse that I never received. When contacting them I got the run around a million times, in the meantime while all this is happening the purse sells out online so I can't even have it replaced. After about 8 email exchanges back and forth, getting no where, being told I would refunded, it was then I contacted asos online to practically BEG them for a coupon code, because nothing had really been resolved and this entire issue was a mistake on their part not mine. They give me a promo for 15 percent off...WOW ALL THIS CRAP AND I GET 15% OFF?! WHAT A DEAL. Not. Anyway I never use it, flash forward almost another year and I order off their website again, clearly haven't learned my own lesson from dealing with them. I order a dress, receive it in about 4 days, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW?! IT'S THE WRONG ITEM. Wrong color, size, BRAND, item code, etc. Like someone just grabbed the first dress they found and shipped it out to me. So I contact Asos telling them how infuriated I am, having another issue with them. I tried to see if I could just order another one, but SURPRISE! In the time it took for me to receive this dress I never asked for, the dress I actually had ordered is SOLD OUT IN MY SIZE. So I contact them. They take two days to respond to me. When I get a follow up email it says that they have arranged a replacement to be sent to me, subject to order availability, and for me to send back within 28 days the dress I had received. Well I wait 2 days, in the meantime checking the site to view the stock in a US size 4. In those 2 days I waited to hear back, I witnessed the dress come back in stock, leave in stock, and come back into stock a HAND FULL of times. But I waited because they said they were sending me the replacement. I also forgot to mention that I had specified after the initial email I was sent that if a size 4 were no longer available that I would take a size 2. WELL I just received an email today saying that they are re crediting my account because the item is sold out. WOW. So I go on the site, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW the size 4 is sold out BUT they have a size 2 in stock. Guess they just didn't care to follow any guidance in my email requesting they send the 2 as backup. And not ONCE through any of this was I offered a DECENT coupon by any employee for an inconvenience that was all their fault. So yea. Have fun shopping with them if you have any issues that arise with this company.

            Service from the company is okay, the order was processed within 2 days and shipped, delivered to my courier's address within a few days. The quality of the items was very good and as seen on the website, however one item I ordered was swapped with something similar (I ordered a red criss cross bikini and got a different style bikini of the same colour). The item is nice, but it isn't what I ordered. I won't return it because its too much of a hustle (I live in Zambia).

            So I've ordered from ASOS on 5 different occasions, all within the same two month period. My first order arrived a month after it was supposed to. My fourth order arrived a week after I'd sent for it. Then another two packages went missing and they had to be re-sent. Seems as though ASOS will do their utmost to make it so they don't have to return the money. I requested a refund on the missing packages multiple times and was ignored and the packages were instead sent back to me against my wishes (I was about to leave the country and the address they were sending to would no longer be able to give my packages). This fifth package has only just been sent out, but considering they could barely manage sending things to a US post office I doubt they'll be able to manage anything in Asia.

            OVERALLOver the past two to three years I have been an avid customer ordering at least two or three orders a month from shirts to pants. And I can honestly say I have had no issues other than sizing which sometimes run a tad bit small, but as far as returns I have had no issue as I just use the ASOS online return service.  From that, I would like to say that I have never needed to contact customer service because I just returned anything that did not fit me correctly.  As for sizing I can understand why the clothes run small as I am assuming the citizens of the UK and the age range who wears fashionable clothes tend to be a bit smaller than the normal American being I am pretty skinny for a guy my age. Also if you just look at their average model they tend to be on the skinny side so it's safe to assume ASOS clothes run a tad bit small or is more form fitting. As of end of 2016, ASOS has added a plus size section for both men and women, as well as, a Tall section and maternity section which was pre-existing and contains all a very numerous selection of clothing. Shipping to the USAOn another note when I first start purchasing stuff from ASOS I can genuinely say I hated their shipping mainly because of the price, but now I love it as they added two-day shipping for a year with a one-time payment of I believe ($20.00) as of (5/5/17). And if you shop at ASOS in the USA or anywhere to be honest this luxury can be invaluable. If you live in the USA know that your order from ASOS will most likely ship from Great Britain. So  two day shipping may take between (2 1/2 days) or (3)but is very unlikely to be three days and I have only had one instance of a package taking three days and it was due to bad weather. Now about the quality I believe you get what at you paid for as well as a good product, now knowing that sometimes in regards to their sweet shirts they do seem a tad bit cheap but still look good.  To end this I believe that Asos is a great company that has a very large selection and is for those who wish to be inn all the latest trends and who don't mind paying good money for good products as well as cheaper products that are fashionable and will last if they are taken care of properly. -----Side note I recommend you use Paypal when buying from them it makes it simple and will prevent any issues with billing other commenters have mentioned.

            I can't be the only person frustrated by only being able to contact ASOS via social media? I know they consider themselves hip and trendy, but some of us oldies actually like speaking to people when we have an issue. I find it can takes days to get problems resolved due to delays on Twitter etc. They're pickets are terrible and I frequently get sent the wrong item and they always devolve responsibility to the courier company in cases of delayed items. Very little integrity all round. I'll take my money elsewhere in future

            Asos used to be great but now that they are online giants, their customer service and reliability is non existent. I purchased Premier next day delivery for £9.99 for a whole year and have had an issue with delivery times on every single order which I have placed. You place an order, get all information from asos stating your delivery will be with you the next day as you expect and then on your delivery day, you get that you won't be getting your delivery until the following day. Questioning this with customer services is a joke. Asos simply cannot deliver reliably which in this day and age and with such other good companies around who offer a water tight next day option, is just unacceptable.

            I had heard REALLY mixed reviews about ASOS and had sworn I would never risk it, but I was desperate for a dress to wear to a wedding and fell in love with one on their site. I looked at the size chart, and found their measurements provided were about accurate to my usual size, so I purchased the size 0 (the size I ALWAYS wear). The dress came, and the material felt cheaper than expected for a $90 dress, but what can you do? I loved the colors and the print, so I was really pleased... until I put it on. The size 0 fit more like a size 6. There is absolutely NO way a person who wears a size 0 would look good in it. It was so wide I looked like I was wearing a potato sack, but the sleeves were so tight they wouldn't have been comfortable if they had been even the tiniest bit smaller. Since I was running out of options and time to find something for the wedding, I decided I would keep it and just have it taken in because I really did like the  print and style and the way it SHOULD have looked. The problem is, I took it to the tailor to have the alterations made, and because the way the material was draped, it was going to require way more work than I had anticipated. At this point, I was totally screwed if I didn't get this dress fixed, so I had to pay the $70 to have it taken in. SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!!!!! THAT is how off the size was!! I was told by their customer service that their size chart was just a general guide (thanks for sharing the obvious, ASOS) and that the actual size of the item would vary based on style, material, etc. While I totally understand that, there is no reason why the smallest size offered in an item should be 3 sizes too big. That is completely unreasonable. Honestly, lower the prices or fix your sizes. I had wanted to spend less than $100 for a dress to wear to this wedding, and ended up spending $160 in the end because I had to fix something that should not have needed so much work. In most situations, I would have no problem spending $160 on a dress I loved, that fit, and I would wear again. I would never spend that much when the dress requires so much work and alterations just to be the item I had originally thought I was purchasing. Needless to say, I will not resort to ordering from ASOS ever again, no matter how desperate I am. I am only giving two sizes because the dresses print and style (AFTER it was fixed - the way it should've looked from the start) were actually really cute and I got a lot of compliments.

            I ordered two dresses for my baby shower this weekend and ordered them far enough in advance to make sure they were delivered today (3 days before the weekend).  My package did not get delivered, you cannot call and speak to anyone and I was told it would take 48 hours for someone to investigate and get back to me.  I asked if they could please next day me a new order (my card was already charged $82) and I was told there was nothing they could do from their end.  The only solution was to refund me the $82 (which takes 5-10 business days) and then place a new order online and I would have to pay for next day shipping, they wouldn't cover it for me even though I originally placed my order in more than enough time to get the dresses when I needed them.  This is not how you take care of a customer and make them want to shop on your site again!

            I ordered a pair of shoes off ASOS and they hadn't arrived after a few weeks. I checked the tracking only to see that the status says attempted to be delivered a week earlier but had not been updated since. I contacted the customer service team to find out where the order was and they advised they would investigate and be in touch with me within 2 business days. I hadnt heard anything after three business days so i contacted them again to question where the parcel was.They then responded and advised that the address it had gone to had South Australia in it, but that they had the correct Victorian address.They then proceed to tell me that they could not send it back out to me again, and i had to wait for up to another 10 working days for them to receive the parcel back at the warehouse, after which they would then have to refund me, and if i still wanted the shoes i would have to go to the website and purchase them again.I responded to them saying i wasn't happy with this option as it was in no way my fault that it was attempted to be delivered to the wrong state, but they weren't willing to provide any alternative options.I wont be re-ordering with ASOS after this joke of a customer experience. I also find it funny that its very difficult to leave any reviews of ASOS, including their Facebook page, which leads me to believe their appalling customer service is standard.

            Spend a lot of money with Asos ( well a lot of money to me ). I have Asos A list level 3. Normally I have no problems with my orders but disappointed with how slow they are to resolve an issue when you do have a problem. I sent back a ring to exchange which they didn't do , I then had to chase it with a number of emails. They then agreed to send on a next day delivery but they sent it to the delivery collection address which is a local Spa . Spa keep refusing it and I keep getting updates from DPD advising it has been refused . Asos have still not replied to my emails to change the address as I cannot change it with DPD they have to . Still not resolved as I write this . Disappointed customer .

            I've given up buying from Asos now. From own-brand items that disintegrate in the wash after one spin, lost parcels, lost deliveries, paying for next day delivery and getting it 3 days later - nobody in their office seems to know what's going on. Add to that their rubbish returns service (two of my items I was accused of not returning them, despite having the proof). Seriously, Asos - you need to get your act together. Absolutely crap.

            I ordered a skirt from Asos in a polka dot color and they sent me the black one instead. The black skirt was about $17 cheaper than the polka dot one. By the time I received the item both the black and polka dot skirts were sold out. Instead of offering me a refund for the difference in price, they said I had to return the skirt, and if I didn't, they would ban me from future purchases. I talked to different customer service people and they all said the same thing-- it doesn't matter if I still like the black skirt, I have to return it or else their stock will be messed up. I took screen shots of all our conversations because I couldn't believe it. They were basically calling me a thief for wanting to keep the skirt even though I paid more than what that colored skirt is worth. Their returns page said refunds are up to their discretion so basically, after insulting and threatening me, it turns out they could have issued me a refund and let me keep the skirt, they just didn't feel like it. I've spent almost $1000 at Asos in the past two years but never again. I used to tell my friends to shop there but now I will tell anyone who will listen not to shop at Asos, the most awful online clothing company in the history of the internet. They would get no stars if that were an option.

            I have bought several things from Asos and for the most part it has been alright. I've had issues with returns and stuff like that, but nothing this horrific. They lost my package - delivered it to a different town, to a different name and when I contacted customer service they gave me generic answers. I asked ""what happens if I don't receive my order?"" and the rep could NOT give me a straight answer, she said ""let's not think like that..."" What the heck?! You tell your customer that if they don't receive the package you'll either resend the order or refund the money. The package is still misdelivered and who even knows how this will unfold. I won't be supporting them again.

            This must be the worse customer service I have EVER had experience  dealing with and I have had some terrible ones. This is particularly the Dutch costumer service of ASOS. I have been trying for weeks to receive refunds to which I am entitled to also according to ASOS but it is just NOT happening. They are the most amature people I have ever encountered. Dozens of emails have passed and still nothing. In every e-mail I have to explain the looong story over and over again, but don't even think they bother to read properly or reply. Apart from the non exsistent customer service their products are of terrible quality. Sizes of the same brand (ASOS) can differ 2 or 3 sizes, it's just a gamble. Furthermore, often the wrong size is sent, products are often damages and/or poorly made. ASOS seriously needs to have a full make over if I ever even would consider placing another order. Shame on you ASOS for treating your paying customers so terrible!

            Never going to buy from ASOS ever again! If nothing goes wrong, then fair enough, I'm sure that they are fine. But if it does then tough luck getting anywhere.I ordered a piece of clothing for a party, time-sensitive so went for Next day delivery. It arrived on time but got delivered no one knows where. A random person signed for it and none of our next door neighbours knew anything about it. It then took a little while to find Customer Service details - not readily available on their website. Got it of internet search - 02077 561 000.When I called, the person on the other end just couldn't care less. I could tell how completely and utterly uninterested he is in the incompetence of a delivery firm they hire and in my predicament. ""72 hour investigation will be opened"", ""nothing can be done"". Not even an apology. At length, after asking again and again, he started checking with the courier. Said will get in contact and the package should be retrieved that day. This didn't happen. I had to call again the next day and do my worst ""customer from hell"" impression, full works including the best that British passive/aggressive sarcasm has to offer. Finally, managed to get out of them that the package was delivered somewhere 10 doors down for some strange reason (!). The courier was supposed to go there and retrieve after hours that day (which would have been too late). Once I had the location, I just went and got it myself. Luckily, these are neighbours that we get along great with and they get deliveries all day so the package was still there. Lucky break.I requested a refund or a compensation for all this stress and hassle and was told to forget it in so many words. ASOS just couldn't care less.This is actually the second time that this happened - they previously misplaced an order that I needed for a holiday, had to go without. They redelivered but it was after the fact.Fooled me once, fooled me twice ASOS, but no more! Not willing to endure Soviet Union style customer service again.

            I ordered a few things at once. Cant remember how many items exactly but I basically requested a refund on the clothing part of the order, and an exchange for a smaller sized boot.It was all sent back at the same time, in the same packaging as that's how it came.I got the email saying that I had been refunded for the clothing so I got rid of receipt and thought cool, boots should be here soon.... Not so. After contacting them telling them the above (that I'm waiting on my boots in a smaller size) they ask for the damn receipt which i got rid of because I had confirmation they'd received the package due to the partial refund....They didn't give a D. That aside, their own brand clothing is very hit and miss- prob more miss. Other brands they stock seem to be on sale from those particular retailers, so do your research!!

            Bought an outfit from Asos using the 4 day delievery. It's been one week and when I called my local USPS they told me they haven't even received it yet. It would be at least a couple more days until they would get my package. If you don't have a timeline for when you need your clothes, maybe give them a try (my friends say they have had decent experiences) but don't bother if you need the package by a certain date. Should have listened to all the reviews that told me they take wayyyy longer than they say. Hoping the return process isn't as frustrating.

            This was my first experience with asos.com. I ordered 9 swimsuits of different sizes, as I didn't know, which size would fit me best. Whatever, I ordered in UK sizes 8 and 10 (36 & 38 in Germany) but had do return all of them, as the quality was extremely poor and not as pictured on their website! Also, even I suspected that 36 wouldn't fit me, I expected 38 to fit me well - but nope! Skintight and you could see through the fabric. The only positive aspect about this whole action was the fast and uncomplicated refund of my money. It took about 7-10 Days, which is quite quick in my opinion, as it takes longer with some other websites. But you have to be careful when returning swimsuits, as the hygiene-protect-sticker may not be removed!

So I thought it would be helpful to consult the customer service. They never ever and gave lame response to my question about the exact measurement. Ya, Based on size chart obviously I know. If my purchase was a correct size based on the chart, I won't even ask! Deh... Giving excuses: the warehouse delay their responses. Or told me to go ahead and get free return. Pls why should I waste time buying something and it's incorrect? Looking at all the bad reviews really verified my doubts.

            WARNING, BEWARE OF ASOS CSAsos simply don't care about their customers, I guess they think they have enough customers so the odd complaint here and there is nothing. The customer service I received during a recent transaction was horrendous. I didn't receive a refund on a return, the amount was around £200. When I contacted asos I was asked to sent through my bank statements to ""prove"" these refunds hadn't been received. After several emails back and forth I agreed to break data protection and send my bank statements through to god knows who... Bear in mind since starting this process I have had around 15 DIFFERENT agents reply to me, it's never the same person twice. Upon receiving these statements, I received a reply to state that the money was actually refunded to someone else, not me, not my name - now they are asking me to track down this person and send their bank statements. This is where I draw the line, I will pursue this with my bank and even my solicitor dependant on whether any laws have been broken here. I will NEVER use this company again, whether I stand to save £20/£50/£100, I don't care. I would rather use a company who cares about their customers. Through this process I even took the time to contact the director of CS at asos, I received a comforting email in return saying I would receive a call etc. Seems it was just more BS. I am certain the complacency of this company will bite them in the bum one day, there are only so many customers you can upset. Looking at the reviews here, there seem to be a hell of lot already. -Dipesh

When the items did arrive there were 2 missing. Tried to contact Asos againand they are quick to tweet back saying they will reply but yet haven't still.There are thousands of people complaining every minute on Twitter about this company with many like myself waiting up to 20 days for a response.Without a doubt the worst customer service you will ever receive.

            There is no way to get in contact with a live person for the US version of this company. You can only email, in which they reply in 24 hours and do not help.

They tell you that you can reply back with another question but no, you can't, because you'll never receive another reply (I guess it doesn't go through).It is a day past my expected order date and there's no tracking as well!

            I'm a frequent customer (nearly every payday). I ordered £300+ worth of stuff next day delivery. Everything was as normal, until I got a email saying parcels have been delivered. I got home and no sign of parcels, so I contacted them. They said they will raise an investigation with DPD. I then had a DPD delivery driver come to my door!! And start shouting at me called me a liar, very aggressive and not letting me close my door!! He said 'I left here in garden' but nothing was there and also on the DPD system they say I signed for it when I didn't!! Who signed for it?? If somebody signed for it surely they would have taken it into the house and the DPD driver wouldn't have said he left it in the garden?? I rang asos and they didn't seem bothered that I had just had this incident with a driver which was totally unproffessional!!!! after two weeks of emails and phone calls they've now closed the investigation as they say it was 'signed for' and delivered. I can assure you it was not signed for!! Nobody was in the house at that time (we can all prove we were at work!) customer services are a waste of time asking to speak to management but continuely obstructed!

            These guys' delivery and customer service is SO unreliable. When I placed a nearly $200 order, what arrived in my order were items that I did not purchase, and certain items I did purchase were missing. When I filed the claim, I requested a REFUND, because I figured ""Ugh, I'm not even going to bother with a replacement at this point."" However, 48 hours after filing for a refund, they emailed me saying that my replacements were on the way! I argued with them, stating I had requested a refund, but that if the replacement was already sent out then I would just return it with other items I intended to return. Those replacements never came. Two weeks later when I checked my email, I followed the tracking of the replacement parcel and it was registered as delivered, but I never got the package! When I contacted customer care AGAIN, they said that they never sent a replacement because I requested a refund, and that the refund just hadn't been processed through my bank yet!  When I told them that it had been over the 10 day processing time, they said,""Oh, well, actually we DID send you a replacement and it has been delivered. Did you check in with your neighbors?'' SUCH BS!!!! I REQUESTED A REFUND IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!NEVER AGAIN.

            Honestly, I probably ordered hundreds of dollars worth of their clothing from their site, and I'm in love.First off, I live in Canada, and this site is based in the UK. Number one thing I was worried about was duties, and surprisingly enough, I had only been charged duties once out of like 20 orders? I didn't mind as I had 3 clothing in that package, and it was due time.Clothing is affordable, and ships usually within 2 weeks. Sometimes even faster. Their customer service is wonderful. At one point, I didn't receive a package for over a month. I called them, and they resent one dress, and refunded me the other; got my new dress and refund within 2 weeks.The only downside is if you want to return something, you have to pay for shipping to return it. But the process is simple enough, and luckily their return policy is reasonable. I usually collect all my clothes that I want to return from them, and send it all in one go.I created an account JUST to review ASOS, cause I was so surprised that it was so negative.Wonderful company, and I cannot wait to buy more from them.

After I had made my purchase I realized that I had forgotten to check for reviews other than the ones from YouTube. I looked them up and saw an enormous amount of bad reviews. I started to panic, but I thought I would just wait it out and see what happens. After only 3 or 4 days my order showed up neatly packaged and in all the correct sizes. I'm really pleased with how it went and relieved that nothing bad happened.

            Like many companies ASOS will make it easy for you to spend your money. However, the company has no customer support telephone number on their website. After much search, I  finally found a telephone  number on their corporate website (which, for your information is 0207 756 1000 If you are ever in need of chasing anything up). 8 out of 10 times, no one picks the customer support line up when you call and often after 10-15minutes of waiting I hang up. To sum up my experience, 1) - My so called next day delivery were delivered 5 days late.2) - The wrong items were sent. I called to request replacements and the wrong items were sent again.3) - I used their online return system to request a collection 4 times the courier never turned up4) - I called them to ask for this to be sorted they asked me to take the item to the post office as Hermes often does not turn up5) - The items was delivered and signed for 2 days later.6) - I received no refund 10 days after returning the item.7) - After 4 go at the number above, I finally got through to someone to ask where my refund was.6) - I was told they did not have a record of the item in their inventory and that unless I could provide a proof of return  they would not be able to process any refund.7) - After providing the proof of return postage I received an email that said a claim will be made on insurance for me to be refunded.8) - The girl on the phone then explained she will send a refund claim to the department concerned and proceeded to end the call without clarifying what was in the return which was supposed ""LOST IN TRANSIT"" although it was signed for.9) - I then asked her what exactly she was going to refund me for. She mentioned one of the items that was missing in the first order I placed.10) - After listing the items that were in the return, I insisted on receiving an refund request confirmation email whilst on the telephone to check that the items were correctly listed before hanging up.As I write this review, a month has elapsed since I had first placed my order. The refund is supposed to take 48 hours after the request was sent. I will see if it ever arrives.Here is my assessment of the problem at ASOS. 1) - The inventory system at ASOS is chaotic. (the wrong items sent to me on 2 occasion carry a label (affixed to the cover plastic) which is different from the item in the plastic)2) - Their customer support operations are skeletal and poorly resourced3) - Their IT system is very slow or they pretend that it is. Often the people on the phone apologise for how long it is taking to load and once I had to call back because the system was down.4) - Someone is the supply chain is being dishonest with regard to returns. I challenged the girl I last spoke to on the phone about how often items get lost in transit. She told me it happens a lot. I am sorry but if items that are certified delivered are being classed as lost in transit, there is a serious problem that I think ASOS need to get to the bottom of.Well that is my experience. Make of it what you will. This company could be a great company if they could invest as much effort in keeping customers happy as they do sourcing cool items.

I received an email saying my order was despatched and would arrive by Thursday, August 18th via the postal service. Thursday came, no delivery. Friday, same thing. Saturday, same thing. I got in contact with their customer service team on two separate occasions. Both times they responded and asked for my information, then the contact completely stopped.

            I've been a size 8 for years and am in almost every store. For some reason ASOS are VERY considerate in their sizing. An 8 is similar to an extra large. It is horrifying to wear their clothes. The first time I thought there was something wrong with my body! I shrugged it off and thought 'maybe its a one off. after all- all online shopping tends to be pure rubbish.' the size 8 skirt i bought literally fell off. but it kept happening. all 8 sizes just kept falling off but i was still an 8 in every other store. I even weighed myself and took my monthly measurements. Their clothes in general are really lovely in terms of material and design but alas nothing fits small thin people. If you are over weight- definitely shop at ASOS. It's like a stylish Monsoon / Evans / Very.co.uk.

            Won't go into too much detail here but I'll briefly explain why ASOS don't even deserve a star. Have been a loyal customer for a few years with minimal problems. Recently ASOS have closed my account down and they have failed to explain why they have done this. Having tried my best to email them several times over a period of time as well as contacting their advisors on Facebook and Facebook Messenger, I'm not getting anywhere. They keep giving me the same answers which has been viewed as a 'fob off'. I've tried to get them to explain what's gone on and they're unprepared to do this - just close my account and wave me goodbye. They have actually admitted in their first response to me, that if I was to email them, it will be ignored. I've never experienced anything like this before, they have reduced me to tears. I've expressed my confusion and disappointment and they are not interested. If I could upload print screens of their response on here, believe me I would as everyone needs to know this is how ASOS treat their customers. I'm on the verge of reporting ASOS to Trading Standards and will be supplying additional evidence to support my complaint. They have been allowed satisfactory time to respond and half the time when they have responded, their response is poor and in no way does it answer any of my questions.I feel discriminated against, whether it's because I'm a student, my disablement, sexuality, gender, etc I'll never know but it is clear for all to see I've been treated very differently.  Be warned - shop elsewhere as ASOS are not worthy of your hard earned money as evident in my case.

            Asos does not make refunds to customers it owe money to, read their Facebook page & You will see this company does not want to give refunds to lot's of it's customers that has returned a order or not recieved their order.My friend & I, have written to this company over 150 times now & ASOS does not want to answer our messages about giving our money back for ordered products that we have not recieved.When people ask ASOS for their money back they won't answer the customer or they will just say wait a few days or keep asking You the same question, trying to do all that they can not to refund Your money back.When customers ask for their money back thru their Facebook page, ASOS will block the customer that has waited months for a refund, so the other customers can't see that ASOS scams lot's of it's customers.If something goes wrong with Your order, which happens to lot's of ASOS customers, then You can say goodbye to Your money.ASOS says it does not scam people, but what do You call a company that does not want to refund it's customers for products that they have not recieved or for products that they have returned, & afterwards ignore.Their customer service tries to make it look like they want to help the customer but afterwards customer service, will not process Your order.We have waited 3 months for a refund, without getting any money back,ASOS scams people, so if You don't want to get cheated, then You don't want to shop at ASOS.No company in the world has a bad customer service as ASOS does, this company can not be trusted.

            Shame on me for ordering a second time from ASOS!I placed an order July 30,2016, with a promised delivery date of Aug. 16,2016 at the very latest.    An shipping confirmation telling us our order had been despatched, on Aug. 04, 2016...reconfirming the Aug 16,2016 delivery drop dead date. And so we waited. Last night ( Aug. 16 ,2016) after delivery hours and with no parcel, i started my queries.  You cannot speak to a rep at ASOS,you online email them ( it;s not a chat...you receive repeated canned replies from and army of different names....)or Tweet them (same canned replies), or Facebook them....  I received no info on Aug 16,2016 , but woke up to an email from ASOS, that I( ME), had cancelled my order and could expect refund in ten business days...that's it that's all...no other feedback through any other avenue...just canned, rote, replies to ""hold tight""    I had NEVER cancelled anything, my first contact was after the delivery date was passed...and I was incensed that culpability was being shoved at me....    I finally got a conversation with a rep on Facebook after asking if customer service were bots...( I had been ""hanging tight"" , for well over twelve hours...)   He eventually admitted that the order was inadvertently returned to ASOS ,by ASOS after a mixup with a delivery company. I was never told...it was never my fault...and other than a ""Sorry"" ...you can order again....That was it. No sorry about the mixup, sorry for blaming it on you.....   My son is disappointed. I am worried, as I have read many comments about difficulty getting refunds in a timely manner.....   Because of ASOS lack of communication and slow refund, I will pay interest on my non order.....   If my refund is not prompt and meets their ten day standard...I will be reviewing again.   Silly me, should have known better...had a tough experienc 20 months ago for a dress for my daughter. ASOS...never again.

            I place an order with ASOS on the august 3rd hoping i receive it in time for my holiday, waited on the parcel for 5 days didn't receive a anything and never got a response to where the parcel was. called them up to let them know i haven't received it yet and was told it was delivered and sign for by someone; told this wasn't true but told me they would investigate which will take 72 hours. Agreed went on holiday then got a call from a family member to say that they  were being threatened by the deliver company HERMES (which asks use) and accusing them of lying and that they will back in evening  when everyone in the address is back. To crown the wholesituation i called up asos as soon as came from holiday and explain this to asos  head office  was told an investigation will done. EVEN THOUGH I ASK TO SPEAK MANAGER, which was refused.ASOS IS TERRIBLE COMPANY STAY ANYWAY !!! its not worth the stress.

            It's the most frustrating process i have ever been through, found some very cool pants and shoe's at their page and as it was even 60-70% off i had to buy it. Then i even pay extra for express shipping, so then the fun starts, it does not arrive on the date specified while ordering, it arrives with a 50% tax customs amount i have to pay, meaning they have added the full value of the things to the customs not the discounted ones. Then i have to try for a full week on facebook to try and contacting them, it literally takes me a full week for them to tell me ""oh that's customs, send it back"". its by far the worst and slowest customer service i have ever dealt it, the worst part is the people working there answer's you nicely but the frustration of only get 1 answer per day makes the whole experience 100 times worse. lets hope i atleast get a refund, saw another review were they didnt.

I needed the dress for a wedding and was afraid it would not arrive in time, as it was already later than the expected date at this point. I emailed asos customer service and the reply came by the end of the day. The customer service team was very prompt and informative. We were in contact over a week long email thread. They were always professional and very helpful.Thank you Bianca, Jakirul, and Ellie for all the help in recieving my dress before the wedding!!

            I ordered a Calvin Klein handbag on 10-7. With the ordernr I was able to follow the package. On delivery-day I traced it and noticed that Asos had left off the apt number. I had given the right address, as can be verified in my account. I called DHL customer service  but they were 'unable to reach the driver'. So I sat at the window, waiting for the DHL van, which had left hours late, their customer service said. At 16.30 I saw on the website that I had 'refused' the package, which I had not. I was pretty desperate to get that bag actually. 10 E-mails and more than a month later the package had 'arrived back in Germany' and I finally got my money back. Looking on the bright side, they said, 'You can order again'! No excuses or explanation. Thanks for the thought but I'm one of those crazy ones who like to get orders in one go without any hassle at all.

            I ordered a pair of shoes from asos on August 3, 2016 and I received them on August 11, 2016. I had ordered from this company once before and didn't have any issues, so I wasn't expecting anything else, but what I had ordered. I open the shoe box to see a pair of very large shoes barely fitting my feet. I look on the box to see that I had received a US size 9.5. I know I had ordered a US size 8.5, but I checked my confirmation email just to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size. I didn't. So they sent me the wrong size. I've never had to call asos for customer service before, so I was surprised to see that they didn't have the number on the website, but I did file a complaint through email. It took about 24 hrs for them to respond. I really just wanted a refund, because I figured that they wouldn't be able to replace the shoes with my size. But in that email I was told that I actually ordered a UK size 8, which is equivalent to a US 9.5. I thought, 'wait a minute. Are they trying to convince me that I ordered the wrong size right now?'. So I pulled up the confirmation email and screenshotted the email stating clear as day that I had ordered a US size 8.5. I sent that email and received one from them 24 hrs later saying that I was a ""star"" for sending them a screenshot. They then stated that there was a ""tech glitch"", which switched my size from US 8.5 to a US 9.5. Am I really supposed to believe that? If there was knowledge of this so-called ""tech glitch"", then why did you feel the need to tell me I'm wrong? Shouldn't you have checked to see if I had actually ordered a US 8.5 in the first place, instead of immediately telling me I ordered the wrong size? And now I have to wait a week and maybe some change for them to receive my package first and then they'll give me a refund. I'm hoping there aren't any other complications, because I can't deal. I won't be ordering from them again, it's too much of a hassle.

            I ordered a jacket that looked nice. As a broad guy, I don't like baggy jackets that make me look huge and boxy, so I ordered a jacket that was billed as a 'slightly' tailored fit, order your usual size. As it turns out, my friend has the same jacket and showed me how it actually fits his frame and how it won't fit mine. I did some more research online and found that it is indeed recommended to order up one-two sizes (I'm already at the top of what was offered.)My order has been on hold for over a week now and there is a notice that there is a shipping delay for at least another week. I asked to cancel my order for the sizing issue and pointed out the shipping delay which should give ample time to make this cancelation in an orderly way, but the response was that it was already boxed up and that I would have to return it (with options and prices, even though it won't ship for another 1-2 weeks.) That is a canned response and one that doesn't consider the customer or the circumstances. I understand that cancelling on an order that is shipping out the next day could cause all kinds of hassle and confusion. I don't consider myself to be unreasonable, but...In effect, what was said, was ""We have put your order in a box and are going to let it sit on the table for another week or two before we ship it. While we have plenty of time to process such a cancelation in a orderly and considered way, we don't do 'flexibility' here. We don't care about you (the customer) enough to make a call down to the warehouse and I am telling you three weeks ahead of time that you will need to pay the money to return this item."" I do a fair bit of my shopping online and I've been ""disappointed, but understanding"" in the past. I get it when there are real reasons for something. I don't get this, I don't ASOS them to do 'good business', and I won't order here again.

The money was taken out of my account but shortly after I received an email. This stated that they needed a photo of my license/passport, a photo of my recent card billing statement. Both had to be sent over in a pdf form in 24 hours or they would cancel my order. Sent all this annoying information over. Emailed them several times with no response for over 24 hrs. Today,  someone finally got back to me saying they now want another license photo and and photo of my credit card. Are these people insane? Is this even safe?

            Hi everyoneI've shopped at Asos many times with no issues but recently I had an issue with an ordered item (parcel tracking number 0307885409059084) because it appeared as delivered when it wasn't. I couldn't get in touch with any helplines to help me track even though it claims to have a 24/7 support team and struggled to find a Asos email address. This is a very stressful experience especially when I made the order with hopes to receive the goods in time for my holiday. As a large and famous company I expected their website to have more clear contact details.  I'm yet to find out the location of my parcel and will wait until next week to call again as these are regular office hours. I fear that my items wont arrive in time and I'm disappointed as I've always had good experiences with Asos. I think this experience alone has put me off ordering from them in future because its looking less likely that I will receive my goods in time for my holiday and if the goods do arrive and dont fit well, when I return from my holiday I will be outside of the return period. I'm very disappointed and urge anyone to reconsider this before they order from Asos. This has added stress to my holiday preparations and I have essentially lost £35 as the item has not turned up.Hannah Rose

            I am beyond disappointed with ASOS products. I ordered 257.16 worth of swimwear, and waited excitedly for delivery. Despite the ""Free Shipping"" that is mentioned everywhere on your website, I was hit with a 90.00 charge at the door for shipping, a completely unexpected charge for me. In fact, had I know about this huge extra charge I would never had purchased the swimwear. You can then imagine my further disappointment when all items were too small. Despite having used your sizing charts,; the bust size is too small. Now I am going to have to ship the items to you, and pay for that shipping. How much money is it going to cost me to NOT to have any new swimwear? And when we took the time to write you and ask, we were basically told, tough luck.

I am an international customer so i did not expect the order to arrive in five days (like it said), but i certainly feel like two and a half weeks was a lot over that time span. The thing is; the package had been delivered to a place i could collect it from sooner, but i did not receive an textmessage even though i entered my phone number. But i don't know if that's asos's fault. All and all i can say i am happy with my order, it was really just the time that brings the total score down.

            I have been a customer at Asos for a few years now, I order very regularly and also sent something back now and then. Delivery is always on time (I order 2-3 times a month). No problems with refunds, it will take 2 weeks, which is normal for most websites. I have had a complaint about a pair of trousers which was tearing apart the first time wearing it. Within 30 minutes after my complaint I got an answer they would send a new one the same day. Did not even provided a picture. Im a very happy customer, and will continue to keep shopping at Asos.

            Asos.com has a way worse rating than they deserve. I've rarely had a problem with then, and if a product was not up to the expected standard, I could always return it. I've had more than 10 orders, and I will keep coming back, simply because their sales aren't matched by any other site out there.

            was ordering some swim shorts and flip flops for holidays.  took ages to place the order, first it wouldn't add items to the basket (""sorry we have technical problems ""), then it would allow me to add items but would not show it in the basket... after a lot of clinking and resetting managed to place the order... fingers crossed it will be delivered...

            I often bought things from this website. Recently order some items around $300 aud all tgt, placed the order on 27th, received a depatched email on 28th but then received a return/refund email on 31st which I didn't do anything to cancel the order. Wrote them emails to try to find out what happened. At first they were giving answers are very general saying could be the carrier couldn't find anyone to receive the parcel which is not possible at all, sent out from uk on 28th and arrive in Australia before 31st? In the end they admitted its something wrong with their warehouse so my parcel got returned. I was getting upset about their attitude but I really like those items so I don't mind to purchase again after I got my refund back, but as I went back to the website check on the items some of them are not available anymore (in previous emails they were saying everything is still available). And all I received from the email just like oh sorry this happened. Worst experience ever.

            Update:  My package arrived only two days after the specified due date.  I didn't realize the package would need to be shipped from the UK. This one was me being totally disgruntled and  I have to eat my words.  Boy do they taste A LOT LIKE CROW.  Good Job ASOS and thank you for your quick customer service response.  ORIGINAL REVIEW NOW RECANTEDGranted, ASOS has beautiful items on their website and because they are an international company, I had hesitated ordering for the longest time.  Luckily, I spent less than $10.00 US on the site so if my order never shows up, I am not out that much money.  I was supposed to have received my package by August 1, 2016 and emailed their ""NO CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT.""  Their website was jacked up so I had to send a manual email to them and couldn't even use the form they had on the site.  I have the most updated tablet, laptop and Chromebook money can buy so it isn't my equipment.  My gut told me to avoid ordering from ASOS and I wish I had listened.  I will be disputing the charge with my bank and trying to get my money back.

            I paid £9.99 for premier delivery. When I queried why my items were being delivered 2 days later than promised, I received the response, ""we're super busy at the moment"". I'm afraid that I don't care how busy the company is, if they're charging for a priority service, they should deliver. I have not at any point been offered any compensation for this so have had to ask for a refund on my delivery charge. Shocking policies / customer service. First tie I've used ASOS for about 10 years and probably the last!

            This company is diabolical to say the least!! They very rarely give you a refund unless you fight for it!! The last one took me 2 months to get back and since the emails I sent either got ignored or seem to ""confuse"" them? I telephoned the Asos help line which I googled!! They made all the promises to sort this out after 4 calls, but then when my phone bill arrived I had been charged over £22!in calls!!! I could not believe it, not only did they not refund me I had this cost on top. When I queried it they said "" oh this isn't our number?? You shouldnt ring these numbers???Unbelievable!!! I sent several complaints but it got me no where, this company shoud be banned from trading.

            They more than likely have what you are looking for and more often than not it is a pleasant experience with free returns. They will even collect the parcels. There are always 'sales' so how much of a sale it can be I'm not sure... however you can find good bargains. Occasionally orders are cancelled when they have oversold which is a pain.

Couldnt get that right either, 3 days later no emails, no order no nothing. Had to call again, turn around to get my money back 5 days !

Customer service were completely unhelpful and you spend so much in telephone calls trying to resolve the issue with them.  The shirt was tat and they insist that you go to the post office to return it yet it was their mistake!!!  Not one apology and when the line got cut they don't call back and make so many excuses their system is down blah blah blah!!!   I asked to speak with a Manager and Holly just said no and cut the line.  So you end up having to spend more money on calls.  I have never come across such an terrible company.  Truly shocking!!!! I will not allow my daughter to use this company again so that's a young customer they have lost but they obviously make so much money they just don't care.  Now I have to take legal action to get my money back as why should they be allowed to get away with it.  So more money to be spent.

            I have returned two parcels in past 6 weeks and both times, an item enclosed in the parcel was not refunded.  The process to then get this rectified was onerous with obstacles put in my way to delay things e.g. providing all details, then being asked two days later to confirm the details again 'for security purposes' before they could do anything; asking to send proof of postage, even though parcel received as part of the refund had been processed.  If this was a one off I could accept mistake, but as happened twice, wonder if deliberate - raised exec complaint which resulted in refund being actioned, but all other queries I raised were ignored

I have no idea how they've managed to get away with as much as they have for so long, seeing other negative reviews only confirms that I will not be shopping there again (after my first buy). I bought a skirt and the one that arrived was nothing like the picture or the catwalk video, I tried to contact the customer helpline and held for half an hour while a repeated automated voice was saying ""thanks for holding we will be with you shortly"" they certainly were not with me shortly!

Found the best way to get a response was to start posting to their FaceBook page (If I had thought to look at the comments on that page prior to buying I would never have placed my order!) It has now been well over 6 weeks and I still have not had a refund from them despite daily assurances it was processed and would take 72 hours... I have started a case with PayPal, but ASOS seem to have mastered the art of manipulating that process to take as long as possible. I think I can guess how they have sufficient experience to know how do that. I will never buy from them again.

            I paid £10 for the year for 'premier' and it's great. Next day delivery, (even got a delivery on a Sunday after ordering sat evening!) easy returns; just fill in the form and stick on the pre paid label and send. I usually get my money back within a week. I'm always notified by email so communication is fine. It's great if you aren't sure of something, you want to see what it looks like or be sure of the size, because it comes so quick and you can get your money back fast. It's definitely my go to site.

            I hope I'm not tempting fate, but till now I've been more than happy with my shopping experience at Asos. I'm really surprised to find so many negative reviews, whereas my shopping with them always runs smoothly.I've  sent back clothing for a refund twice without any trouble. Whenever I contacted them by mail I got a reply within reasonable time. My purchases arrive more or less before the expected date. Their site is next to perfect compared to others and their prices are very competitive.

            I have returned multiple items via ReBOUND and after a couple of days, I received an email telling me that my parcel has been returned. I haven't heard from ASOS since, and it's almost 2 weeks ago. They don't answer any of my messages whatsoever. I liked ASOS, but after this experience I will never use them again. I can see that I'm not the only one. Can't believe you're one of the biggest internet companies.

I emailed my complaint and they had the nerve to tell me that I ordered wrong and order a UK 6 which was a US 8..... Which clearly on the order it says I ordered a 7.

            I emailed asos on the 1st of July with a complaint and have still not received a reply. I received a faulty damp smelling dress which I reported to them, they sent me out a replacement pretty soon which was good. However, the replacement dress also had the same damp smell. I was then advised that they can't offer me any discount but may be able to cover dry cleaning costs, but then another person told me that this was not the case as the dress is machine washable.  I expressed how I didn't want to keep the dress at full price incase the smell doesn't wash out. After several weeks of waiting for email replies and taking time to contact via telephone on the last email I was told that they cannot offer me a discount on the dress and the most I could received was 10% off a full price item. I didn't think this was sufficient for all my time that was wasted and the poor customer service I dealt with so I sent a final email which is below:HiI am so upset to hear that the most u can offer a loyal customer of many years is a 10% off code off full price items only.  I will be returning the dress today, it has been a waste of my time contacting you via phone and emails several times hoping that you will help me. I have waited weeks to hear back from you and your time to respond has been appauling.I will be making this public and informing others of your poor customer service and no customer loyalty.

            So I ordered 2 bridesmaid dresses for a wedding, one pink, one grey. Other bridesmaids made similar orders at the same time as me. Everyone else received theirs. I didn't. They told me to wait until the following wednesday. Of course, it didn't come. My order was ""dispatched"" and my tracking information on asos said nothing, and the tracking information with Hermes just said ""order placed"". I alerted them to this immediately because it should have updated to say dispatched and then when it got scanned to be at a local depot etc, then out for delivery.Of course this never arrived, I doubt it was ever sent.Customer service told me if I was worried about it not arriving I could order it again and return one set. So, not helpful, why should any of us make 2 orders just in case one gets messed up?By the time they'd accepted my order wasn't coming (a week later), the grey dress was out of stock. The pink dress was in stock. Customer service informed me they would re order the pink one for me (next day delivery).Next day...a grey dress arrives. So even though this dress was out of stock, they've managed to get it and send it to me, and even though the pink one was in stock they were unable to send this. There was no earthly reason why they couldn't have resent my actual order. Or why it was messed up in the first place.When I informed them I had received a grey dress, they said they were unable to re order the other due to stock issues. Which is an absolute lie. They were 100% in stock at the time. And the grey dress was not. So who even knows how they've managed that. Customer service carried on to ask if it was in stock why didn't I order it? And no, I'm not paying twice for my original order. When I make an order I expect to get it. Not have to re order things every step of the way when they keep messing up.And quite frankly I don't want to give them my business. I ordered two different sizes to try on for the wedding, thankfully the one I have fits fine and I really don't want to go through this process again just to try the other one on. At least I've got one I can actually wear to the wedding. Really would never use them again, if it wasn't for my friends wedding I would return this dress, but knowing how bad the customer service is, that would probably never get refunded. They have refunded me for the one dress (that wasn't even out of stock). Great. So I made an order, and they can't carry it out and have refunded me for half of it, that they could have actually carried out. Absolutely ridiculous and totally incompetent. No apologies, no offer of a partial refund to make up for the ballache of trouble their idiocy caused. Just, oh well we'll give you the money back for one we can't be bothered to re order.Bye Asos. Never again.

Terrible experience with ASOS brand. Next time i'll get some topshop.Unable to provide an answer i am highly doubtful that i will ever be refunded. I feel utterly disgusted by the way i have been treated - Do not buy here they don't give a flying F about you and just want your money & silence.

            This is such a shame, because I had no problems with ASOS a few years ago when I purchased from them (although I don't believe I had any issues I needed to contact them about). But with my most recent order, they sent the wrong item. I messaged them twice, and two months later, still no response. Sad Trombone.

            I love ASOS clothing and have been a customer of theirs for years. I've never had an issue with ordering or receiving my product... until now.I made an order with ASOS for $159 on June 12th to a temporary address I would living at for two weeks. I work on the road, so I'm rarely in one location for more than a few weeks at a time, so I made sure to place the order so it'd definitely arrive within my scheduled stay at the address. The delivery date was June 16th, and it came and went by without my package showing up.I immediately contacted ASOS through their website about the missing package and the frustrating song and dance began. At their request, I contacted all the shipping companies that handled my package. UPS  handed my order off to USPS for final delivery, but they had no record of my order. I checked all around the mail room of the apartment I was staying at. I even knocked on neighbor's doors to see if the package was accidentally delivered to them to make 100% sure the package wasn't delivered. ASOS is very slow responding to customer service emails. I wish they had a phone number so I could have talked to ONE person about my issues all at once, but using the email I talked to multiple people over a two week period. Every time I talked to a new person, I had to give them all of my information again. Order number, email address, date of birth, and what my problem was. Repeating this information over and over made me feel like I was talking to a brick wall, because each customer service agent seemed to have to start the entire process over again each time we spoke. If I felt like my issue was allllmost resolved and they told me they'd get back to me with an answer, the next day a new person would message me asking me to explain the whole situation again. Now it's more than two weeks later and over a dozen emails back and forth with their customer service and I've finally given up and disputed the charge with my bank.It took them a good week to investigate my order and decide if it was indeed missing. By the time they decided they could replace my order, I was no longer at the original address the order was sent to. For whatever reason, they refused to ship the replacement order to a new address. They said it had to be the original address to avoid confusion and lost orders, even if I was no longer at that address.I explained that the order would definitely be lost if they sent it to the original address and asked them to send it to my permanent address, as at that point, I was finished with my job that kept me on the road. I asked them repeatedly not to send the order to the previous address with no luck. I even got into it with them on Twitter, hoping to get a more immediate/better response than contacting them through their email/website. Nope. There is no reasoning with their customer service. No matter how many times I explained my situation, they refused to make an exception for my case. They also would not respond to any questions about refunding my order (except for refunding $50 for two items they couldn't replace as they were out of stock- though I won't know for sure if they actually refunded it for a week or so) as they were sending a replacement order... that I would never get. As of this morning, my replacement package has been sent to the wrong address and I felt like pulling my hair out. It was clear they weren't going to be reasonable and help me, so I contacted my bank and I'm in the process of disputing the charge.I'm totally bummed. I spent my entire summer clothes budget on ASOS and I loved everything I picked out. Hopefully the dispute will go through and I'll get refunded and can spend my money elsewhere.This experience was so bad that I will no longer shop with them and that's the worst part. I can't give them my money when they've shown such disregard for my concerns and ignored my requests to refund my entire order.I hope whoever is at the previous address gets my order and keeps it, to be honest. I hope they're my size and can enjoy some free ASOS clothing.

(Would of been nice if they informed me as I did have an order number and ect). To be honest I couldn't remember all of the items but I still ordered £100+ worth of stuff again (didn't get some of the items from before as I then couldn't find them which was REALLY annoying). I waited for it today then in the last 40mins of my three hour delivery time I got an email saying that my items won't arrive today.

            ​Had a great experience with ASOS. Great clothes which fit me really well. Recently bought a bomber jacket 3 months ago. Which started to fade with orange patches on it. Complained to ASOS, returned it and got a full refund, which was awesome. Wish they wouldn't use Hermes delivery which can be a bit dodgy. Great experience so far

            Ok it's going to quite a long story because I'm really not happy with my experience with ASOS.I wouldn't say I shop at ASOS all the time but it's quite frequent and at the end of the day I pay towards their business every time I do.I have been shopping around for some black boots for a while when I saw some I loved on their website. Now this was on a Monday and I knew I had the day off Tuesday so I ordered them and paid the extra delivery charge to ensure i was in when they delivered. So this was a charge of £5.45. I had to do this because I live in apartment block so there was no 'safe place' or couldn't leave with neighbour because you had to let someone in from the front door through a phone in your apartment. They had no way of getting in unless someone did this. I waited in all day for my parcel to then recieve a text from DPD saying sorry we missed you?! I was confused. I went downstairs and the delivery guy had been let in cause he posted the note through our postal box downstairs in the hall. (I live in the 5th floor). This was about 2:55. On the note that he left he had put 3! I was very angry he had made absolutely no effort or attempt to contact me in my apartment and so he could get paid and finished he just posted that clearly made up a time and off he went.Being very upset that I paid the charge for nothing if their employees weren't going to do there job properly, I contacted DPD as it was their delivery driver in the wrong. Back and forth emails with me getting more and more frustrated they then decided it isn't anything to do with them it's ASOS. So I contacted them, explained it. And all because the delivery driver took a photo of my apartment block name it was proof he had been there and made his attempt. They had no sympathy what so ever for this situation. And in their emails pretty much makes me out to be a lier. I work full time and travel a lot of hours  so couldn't just pick it up from anywhere because of there opening times. So I had to choose a place that suited me and go out my way to pick it up. I paid £5.45 for no reason and then cost me in fuel to go out my way to pick it up. I have lost complete faith in ASOS and the companies they use, and will not be shopping with them ever again. Now if they fixed the situation and refunded the delivery charge back it would be different but they have done nothing what so ever to reconcile this.

            I placed my first order with ASOS on 6/16. I was supposed to receive my order on or before 6/23. It is 6/27 and I still have not received my order. When I contacted customer service, they advised me to check that the address is accurate- it is. Inquire with anyone in my household if they accepted the package, check with neighbors, and the postman. I live alone and place a check mark next to the other two. Now what? They are investigating the delivery. If I do not receive the merchandise I paid for, I will report them for fraudulent practice, and I will do everything in my power to get my money back. I should receive the item I paid for, or I should get my money back. If they are a reputable company, they will be responsible to their consumers. I will update my review when I receive a response from them.

            I read A LOT of reviews about Asos, mainly that their order never arrived. I was skeptical about ordering from them, but I decided to anyway. The package came faster than estimated! They shipped the package on Thursday (NZ time), and arrived Tuesday morning! 3 days earlier than estimated, really pleased by it. The only issue I had, which I tend to have with ordering shoes online, is that they are not to true to size. I myself am a 9.5, and my mother is a size 10. She can fit it, but its pretty tight. I always order 10, since I always have this problem when buying shoes online. So if you are a size 10, try to order a 8.5UK shoe size instead of 8UK. Otherwise buying from Asos was an easy process!

            Ordered £100 Nike air max bw Persian. Asos sent defective items, one trainer in a size 8 and the other in a size 8.5, I phoned Asos Monday 20th to tell them of there mistake but unfortunately the computers where down at the time. I was told by Asos I would receive the replacement pair of trainers as late as Friday 25th, still no replacement trainers. I phoned Asos late Friday to ask why I didn't receive the replacement, again computers where down. I now have no trainers and no email to say as and when I would receive the trainers I purchased for £100 pounds. I'd recommend people stay well away from this company, in my mind Asos are thiefs and corrupt. Do not buy from them...

They did not respond to my tweets, they took 5 days to reply to my FB...still waiting for them to reply on there. When I emailed they accepted that they had made a mistake but did not do anything to rectify it. I am now without the shoes. I brought 3 pairs of the shoes to be used at a wedding I am now 1 down. ASOS do not provide a telephone customer service so things are slow to be resolved and on email they just fob you off.

            I have never had any problems with ASOS and I have shopped with them eleven times. Their website is aesthetically-appealing and easy to use. They pride themselves on their branding which, as a creative Advertising student, I really appreciate. They thoroughly understand who their target audience is; (young adults) and always include black models in their images and advertisements which is always refreshing to see. They also offer student discount, free postage and free returns (yay). I love you ASOS. :)

            I like ASOS, I am a frequent customer and most of the time I am very happy with my purchases. However, my last few purchases have left me with such a negative experience all because of their poor customer service. I am aware that the margins are small on clothes and that I am not spending thousands of pounds, but I would still expect a better experience than this. I have received a better experience than this at other competitors, and I have never left a negative Trust Pilot review in my life before. My issue with the customer service is that they frankly do not respond. When they do respond, it's simply to say how busy they are and will get back to you soon. Days later, you have to follow up. Most likely, you'll receive the same response again. I ordered an outfit that I was supposed to receive last Friday. It still has not showed up, and I am still waiting for Asos to investigate and refund me if it's been lost. But because they're so busy, I am still waiting... while they have my money. If you look at ASOS Twitter you'll see my situation repeated over and over again. The sad thing is that I really don't think ASOS cares about how their brand comes across considering its displayed on such a public platform. Additionally, most companies know that the customer service department is the saviour of the company. They're supposed to make the bad stuff, good. But the sad thing is - with ASOS they actually tarnish the company. So moral of the story - shop at ASOS and you'll most likely like the clothes and fingers crossed nothing goes wrong because if you have to contact their customer service department, God forbid, you are screwed. Look at me. I'm still waiting.

Since calling the day I should have received my order, Asos have fobbed me off reassuring me the parcel will be delivered the following day, they have taken the money (over £100) already from my account and I am still without my goods.  i am actually gutted at the service because before this I thought Asos was a genuinely great site but after this I will never shop here again and urge others not too, unless you want to spend most of your time chasing your order. It's ridiculous. I'm now going to spend tomo morn on hold for 45 mins again to now cancel my order and then have to wait 5 days for a refund and for what!? A waste of my time.

            In this era of HIGH competition, all ASOS can do is lure you with excellent videos.  I tried to register for 5 days to take advantage of their last sale--completely unable to.  Their Facebook 'customer service' is a complete joke: hipster doubletalkers who sound like they're having a latte at Starbucks while checking posts.  They can offer NO credible help or solutions, they just blather on till you give up in frustration and go away.

            I never write reviews however I wished I would have read others before purchasing from ASOS. After a month of trying to find the perfect maternity dress for my baby shower I settled on one from ASOS. Beyond excited they actually had my size I ordered the dress. The following day I received notice my dress had shipped and would be there within 4 days!!! Those days came and went and after 6 days I emailed their customer service for an update. Instantly I received a response asking questions ""to better help me"". After 6 days they still never responded again. I then choose to go onto Facebook only to find I'm not the only irritated customer, there's thousands..yes thousands! I publicly posted on FB and which a slew of private messages were exchanged but only after I publicly complained multiple times. After all the stalling and being told I need to ask my local post office, I received a message from the shipping department that the dress is out of stock and they can't replace the item and will refund my money. Basically they NEVER sent the item and wasted my time.

            Worst experience ever! No response to emails reporting a missing parcel. Had to go on Facebook and make a public post. Had some generic 'we're super busy' apology and promise to look into. Reported 23rd may, still no resolution by the 14th June. Received comments like ""if you return the goods we can sort your refund for you"", despite the fact the query was regarding a missing delivery!  Didn't bother contacting DPD - asked me to sort all of the tracking etc , even though DPD are contracted by ASOS. No phone number, contact with a human who can actually help is virtually impossible.

            Having shopped with ASOS for over 10 years now and a usual Premier Account holder, I am left disappointed by their current service. A lack of response on Facebook and emails makes me very nervous for my missing order. The one response I got felt very patronising; ""check with a neighbour"", like I hadn't done that already?My item was supposedly delivered when I was out, yet no delivery card was left to suggest this, nor did I receive the usual delivery notification email. When tracking my order on Hermes it would seem the item was left ""in a secure location"". If only I knew where said secure location was!! An order I placed 10 days before an event is now going to mean I don't get to wear the skirt I planned to and i'm left with no choice but to shop with a competitor. Not a happy bunny.

            I've ordered from ASOS on a number of occasions, and they've all turned out good. Correct sizing, good quality, fast shipping. Basically, it's great until you encounter a problem and therefore need to approach the customer service - that's where it becomes a pain in the neck.My 6th and final order from them was an order I had really anticipated. It contained 5 items that I was eagerly hoping to try on, impressed by the previous 5 purchases. That order, never came. I contacted the customer service, and was each time, told to do the exact same thing of clarifying my address, checking with my neighbors, checking with my post office, by different employees. Clearly, for good customer service, clarifying once is enough. I usually keep my calm in situations of an order mishap because I understand it's hard to control so many orders and mistakes are bound to happen. However, I do expect prompt and sincere customer service when something goes wrong. I judge a company not by how good the products are - since some companies are basically resellers for other brands, but by the quality of their customer service. And the 6th order, the first encounter with their customer service, was the order that didn't make me want to return again.For a refund of £25 (that's not even a large amount, mind you), I waited 1 month for it. Of which, at least 3 weeks were wasted on clarifying and re-clarifying my address again and again, until I finally lost it and politely told the employee off.

            I made the order and got brown loafers instead of black one. I tried to get back my money but for that I need to send back the loafers (which means to spend time and money) and only after that I can get back my money. But that was their mistake! I don't get why should I spend my money and time by sending back the wrong item. By the way the quality was good however I would not use this shop ever again and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.

            Merchandise is absolute crap.  Sooooo disappointed in the crap quality of this company!  One blazer ordered, terrible fit.  Tight under armpits but hung almost to my mid thigh.  Ordered according to their size chart but ordered a size bigger just in case-lot of good that did me when I can't move my arms in the blazer.Decided it was a fluke so I ordered a sequin top a month later.  Fit completely off just like the blazer but I wore it anyway🤗Washed it by hand and sequins fell off.  WHAT?Worst clothing company ever with a GREAT website.  I absolutely love the clothes but will never ever make the mistake of wasting $112.00 on two items I could of bought from China and would of lasted longer.Thanks ASOS!🖕

            I ordered Steve Madden sandals. But sandals have not their original box and all over scratched, wrinkled, faded and one strap is fell apart then glued. I create 2 queries on their site. But no answer. I wrote message to Facebook. No answer. They haven't Live CHAT. And finally, I opened twitter account for this occasion. And I tried to chat whole night by twitter. But I can't get answer. I understand I must return 45 pound sandals for 47.7pound by DHL.  They said If.... We refund your return shipping cost.

            I've been a customer for years to the point of paying for their premium next day delivery service. But my recent experience has left me wondering what is going on in the company. My ""next day"" delivery wasn't made (although they at first tried to allege that it was and then backed down), then they ""delivered"" by throwing the item over the back fence in the pouring rain. And we were on holiday for a week!When I complained I was told that I could get a refund or replacement (but there was no recognition that this wasn't acceptable and that I'd been let down). You can get a refund or replacement on a product as standard and I was told that this was, ""the only outcome that was possible"". No matter how many times I asked them to explain what had happened and why, they refused to answer my questions and told me that there was no way for me to escalate the issue. The product might be good, the service might be quick, but when things go wrong ASOS will leave you standing on your own and they simply don't care about you - no matter how long you've been a customer. Profits before service.

            I ordered $400 worth of merchandise with expedited shipping from them a few days ago. I then received an email stating that they were unable to process my order and that it had been canceled. Not only are they unreachable via email, but when they will tell to try to contact them via Twitter and Facebook which is just us useless. ASOS should be ashamed of themselves for actually referring to itself as a retailer. These people are scam artists and I'm not sure how they are actually in business.

            I ordered an on sale jumper for $171. It has red and blue colour and a very nice diamond shape pattern. Three week later I received a completely different style ugly brown jumper with a new label (right one) stick on top of the brown jumper label. I went to their website and through a long process of notifying, sending them pictures of what I ordered and what I received, and returning the item (paid for postage first, refund later policy). To my amazement, they sent me back an exactly same wrong one. I again went through the same painful process. Any of my email were replied by different people but exact same patronising ignorant tone like sorry that you got wrong item, we will investigate. Finally they said 'there is stock issues' and refunded through PayPal.My postage cost of $21, however, they said can't be refunded through PayPal or voucher. I have to go to my account put in my credit card number as default card to get my money back. In the end I gave up my $21. To sum up, they advertised a product they don't have, then stick a fake label on some craps to send it off with the hope that their return process is too painful that people will give it up. I did not hear a word of apologise for bad practice, just excuses after excuses (stock issue??). This is my last experience with asos.

            This is my first review here and I had to write something since I've read more bad than good reviews on this site.I accidentally stumbled upon trustpilot.com, after already having two orders shipped from asos.com and asos.es just a couple of days before and I was honestly concerned about those. The orders didn't arrive exactly on time but I was paitent enough not to bother the customer service and decided to wait a bit more (it wasn't as easy as it seems) :) so eventually the orders did arrive and I'm very satisfied with the clothes and shoes (ASOS brand and VERO moda). I love ASOS! Everything fits me, quality is nice, only their ankle boots ('against the wind') are half a number bigger, nothing to stress about. However, the third order arrived on time.Since I am from Serbia, it usually takes a couple of days more or up to ten days for any order to arrive to my small town (seems that at customs clearance they keep packages longer than they should, so it's actually my country's fault if I don't get them on time).Hopefully ordering some more in the near future.Aleksandra R.

            My delivery date was today, when I logged on to check the status of my order (I have ordered dresses for a wedding I am attending), it said they had been delivered last night at 6pm. I knew there were people in the house then and was concerned so I rang customer service and was cut off twice, got through to head office and was told there were some problems and to ring back. Rang an hour later and after being on hold for about 25 mins, was told that the tracking system is regularly wrong and there is nothing that can be done about it! I have been told there is a delay on my order (which I hadn't been told about) and that I should ring back on Monday if it still hasn't come.... The customer service person spoke over me numerous times and was very defensive that I was asking questions about it..... not great.

            Asos sent me a £5 voucher, I used this and there was a high volume of traffic when I paid for the item so something went wrong their end, when I tried to do the transaction again the voucher was not accepted.I tweeted them, waited three days and got a response saying someone from IT would look in to it, as yet still nothing and it's been over a week. Customer service has gone downhill so much in the last year, to the point where unless you tweet them publicly, which I did, they don't care.  won't buy from them again, until I hear of improvements made to their customer service and response time, which is a shame as I bought nearly all my clothes there, will not be doing that from now on.

            Asos have sent me the wrong pair of shoes TWICE within a week. I went out my way to send back the first size 5 pair, only for two days later the same size 5 pair to get delivered AGAIN. I needed them for the weekend so ensured I got next day delivery, but TWICE I was sent the wrong order. Disgusting. When I finally got through to customer care all they could say was that they was a problem with the warehouse and that they were hesitant to send them to be again. They said they would chase this problem up yet it has been a few days and I have heard NOTHING. I am livid and frustrated with the lack of customer care.

            I ordered a dress from asos for my prom. I had previously ordered a dress off another website but it went badly and as my prom was only a few days away I began to panic. Asos are a UK based company and so shipping to me would be quick, that is the main reason I chose to purchase from asos - because I was in a time crunch. I picked a lovely sequenced dress and due to the price of it, I was offered free next day delivery which was a god send for my situation. However, when I received the dress it was too big and so I asked customer service if an exchange would take long due to my limited time. They replied fairly quickly with the solution of buying the dress again but in the corrected size and getting a refund on the one that is too big. It was a Friday which meant not only would I have to wait until business days for the dress, it was also a bank holiday Monday meaning the soonest day I would receive my new dress was a Tuesday - only 2 days before my prom. As I had already purchased two dresses (the one from another website and the one from asos) using my mum's credit card (and prom dresses are expensive) my mum did not have enough money left in her bank account as it was the end of the month. My uncle gave me his credit card to use, however, as my uncle lives in a different location from where I had stated on my asos account (which is mandatory to purchase from asos) asos declined my purchase and locked my account, probably thinking I had stolen the credit card. They emailed me telling me to send them multiple forms of ID such as passports and bank statement proofs in order to unlock my account and continue my purchase. But I had no time for that lol. I made a new account at used my uncle's paypal to purchase the dress with the next day delivery offer again. It came in on the Tuesday still a little too big which I was surprised by as they have a sizing guide available online, and if following that, there was no chance at all of me fitting into anything lower than my original order. As I mentioned, the dress was sequenced and with every slight movement I could hear hundreds of little sequence bouncing off my floors, not to mention the fact there was a catch in the fabric and a burst button which I had to sew. Yet, the refund for the first dress from asos went by without a hitch and it was fairly quick. I also managed to get to prom looking cool in my dress :-) The end.Takeaways as this was so long lol:*Sizing guide has a fairly large leeway. (for me)*If you buy a sequenced dress, even from just trying it on you will be surrounded in a pool of sequence that have fallen off (they do provide a little bag of sequence to sew them back on though)*Quick and helpful customer service replies.*Very quick deliveries to UK.*Very good security against fraud lol.*Quick refunds.

            I like ASOS and they usually do things correctly, but these past two separate times that I've ordered from them, the packages have been delivered later than the date that was said when I first ordered it. The most recent was a belt I ordered on the 29th of May that was promised to be delivered on the 3rd of June. I was hoping to wear it to an event on the 6th but I got an e-mail saying I should wait for it to arrive on the 7th, which is when I kind of don't need it that much anymore. So, it was basically a waste of money for me. I'm not sure if it's the fault of ASOS or something else, but if this is gonna happen where I don't get a tracking number and it arrives approximately 4 days after the promised delivery date, then I am not confident in ordering online from this company. I like their clothes and their website but now it's like if I need to order something for an event I need to do it weeks earlier because I expect the delivery date to be delayed...that's not normal. If the shipping was free I would be less annoyed but, it wasn't.

            I've had great service from asos for the past three years. I've made about 20-30 orders in that time, and only once have I had any problems. That was when I received someone elses order, emailed asos to let them know and they sent out the correct stuff straight away.Sure, the quality can be a bit iffy sometimes with certain brands (I'm looking at you, ASOS homebrand!) and can be a little expensive, but that can be cured with the discounts codes they commonly have on and student discount rocks.Definitely one of the better retailers out there, that's for sure.

Not good.I ordered several items and bought a pair of stylish glasses from my favorite brand as ASOS must know and received a pair of ridiculous cheap bracelet instead. I am very frustrated since I had issue with my delivery and as I am myself working for a big luxury fashion company I am fully aware of those issue but it doesn't feel great, and I am so disappointed also to find the CC team email address I had to wing since on google it does not appear anywhere.

            I just had my first and Last shopping experience with ASOS! As the old saying goes if it's to good to be true it is the case! Deceptively untrue in my experience. As they sell good brands I was called into thinking they may be another great online option like The Iconic or Surfstitch but NO way ASOS has proved absolutely terrible in more ways than one! Start with the Customer Service- rate it at a 1 out of 10. Email them and expect a generic response that does not provide an answer let alone a solution or even any individual review of your case. Do expect a patronising ignorant reply. Eg click here and you will see a size chart! Oh really Sherloch you do not think I didn't look at size charts and reviews of show sizing before ordering 6 pairs of men's shoes?!So as for the shoes. Yep 6 pairs of them ordered each pair as per each males usual size. Ensured I knew their European size and their UK & US size. Looked online at customer reviews which mentioned ASOS shoes were tts.... We get the shoes and NOT one pair fit one person. each and every pair are TOO small this shows consistency. I write to ASOS and they suggest I look at size charts! Disgusting and disgraceful response!! What a joke. I shop online on a weekly basis and have only come across one or two as dreadful. Will not be back!!Oh and just to make matters even worse yes they can get worse....they do not exchange for compensation of their inconsistent Sizing.....nope refund and repurchase is the only option. So by the time you manage that chances are item will be sold out or in my case back up to FULL PRICE so not worth buying! As original was bought on sale!

            Wow I don't know why there are so many bad reviews for ASOS, I've been shopping on their site for years and have only ever had one wrong item delivered and they rectified it immediately without any issues so you cannot fault them. I do have ASOS premium which means I get my order the next day and I couldn't recommend it more, super cheap for an entire year and their site couldn't be easier to shop on. I love all the items and choice you get compared to the high street shops.

            I love ordering from ASOS because they have a lot of different things - though I think the new things about returns for danish customers is kinda annoying. When you have to return something very heavy or large it's nice, but when it's small things it's really annoying. Now you have to go to ASOS and fill out a form which means that the return costs will always be 63 DKK (or around that), when before you would just pay the cost at your local post office, meaning that you often just got away with paying around 30 DKK.

            Out of at least 20 purchases I've now run into my first problem ever when buying from asos.com.During check-out, that is, during payment, an item was removed from my shopping bag. This did not appear anywhere, not even during payment where I agreed to pay for both items and as a result, the shipping was free. However, since one item was removed without me knowing about it, I lost this one, and also had to pay shipping for the other item.I contacted asos about this and eventually had the issue solved. It took me 7 emails over 6 days, which would by far not land them in the 5/5 star category when it comes to customer service, however, I will say this:- The responses from customer service came very fast- I did not once feel forgotten or treated unfairly- My issue was handled very professionally- Customer service was understanding and did actually look further into my issue, eventually finding the errorI think an advice would be to be a bit persistent when it comes to customer service. It is also important to understand that they need all the information you have before they can help you. I do think if I had been clearer in my first email, it would've taken less time to solve my issue.In conclusion: So, with that said, my issue solved, and my twenty other successful purchases, asos lands on a 5/5 rating in my book.

            I have been using ASOS for many years. I love the versatility of the clothes and that it cares for unusual tastes. However, in recent years their customer services are abysmal. Here's my last shopping experience.I ordered on Sunday before 5pm for next day delivery. ASOS app showed my delivery as next day (Monday 23rd) which was what I needed as I am going on holiday on Tuesday and I needed some last minute items. Order was placed successfully and paid for. A few minutes later I received a confirmation email which I didn't thoroughly read. Today, after seeing my order has not been dispatched I checked the confirmation email and it says my order will arrive on Tuesday! The confirmation email was received at 5pm (showed them email screenshot) which proves my order was placed before 5pm. I contacted customer services to complain and ask them to stop order as nobody will be here to receive parcel and my neighbours have stolen parcels before. I will not be back from my holidays until mid June and the parcel can't be left out for three weeks. I was told they've packed it so they can't stop it even though it's still at their warehouse. If they deliver the order which has not even been dispatched yet and it gets stolen/lost who will be held liable? I asked them to stop the order at 7am. The order was dispatched at 4pm. They couldn't have stopped it in 9 hours? Even though it was their website's fault?I think this is where I stop giving them my money.

            A little over a year ago I stopped shopping at asos due to an issue in returning an item that they had shipped a size that was different than what I had ordered. The whole process of returning the mis-sized item was a headache, but in order to not be charged for that item as well as one in the correct size, I had to figure out a way to get it back to them. I hadn't placed an order with asos in over a year, but then recently decided to give them another shot. The item I ordered did not arrive by the date that I had been told it would be delivered ""on or before,"" so I reached out to customer service, who said to wait a few more days to see if it gets delivered. Due to the lack of tracking service, they weren't sure why it hadn't been delivered. I want to like this company, I can always find clothes there that I love, but I would rather not have to sit on my hands and wait to see IF my order will arrive because there is no way for me or them to track the shipment.

            I've been a longstanding customer of 6 years and have ordered massive amounts of clothes here. My last order in April did not please me so I've returned it AND they confirmed receiving it by mail. After a total silence of 3 weeks, no refund (over €200!!!) And so it begins, I need their customer service, which reply the same every time, asking for order numbers, which I gave but they simply keep on asking them. After 5 emails they asked me for 1,5 months worth of bank statements with all amounts visible, also the non-asos related amounts. (is that even legal?)Surely they can see if they refunded a customer or not, why do I need to PROVE myself? Bad service, and only reachable by mail. By reachable I mean they answer you no more than once a day.

            Some clothes I got from ASOS were amazing. Great prices, amazing quality and cool styles. Some on the other hand were poorly made, and didn't fit quite nicely. I learned that it's the best to get many items, try them on then return items that you don't like. Return takes a bit longer than I expected but the process is so easy!

            The first time I ordered from ASOS was so easy, and I loved the bathing suit I purchased. The second time I ordered a dress I needed for a wedding function. Somehow ASOS couldn't provide me with a tracking number. They claimed it was the shipping method I paid for (standard shipping), but I had used the same shipping on my first order and received a tracking number.From the time I ordered the dress to when I was issued a refund was two weeks. After the arrival date passed, ASOS customer care asked me to wait an additional four days for it to show up. They also asked me to check with my neighbors and at my local post office for the package. As a company, you should know where my package is through a tracking number. Not only did I have trouble getting my refund, but also getting in touch with customer service was a horrible experience. I emailed and sent DMs on Facebook just to get my refund. The email I received back said it would take 5-10 days for the refund to appear on my card. So now I'll see how long it takes to get my money back. I will never order from ASOS again.

            I've shopped at ASOS for years and have been usually pleased with their products. There are a few issues, though, that are completely frustrating with the website and communication. First, although I've had a longstanding account, it bothers me to no end that items stay in my shopping cart for only an hour.  If one has an account, the cart should have the same status as a wish list;  the last huge order I made I had to re-enter the items individually 4 times because I wasn't finished making up my mind.  Very silly. Also, with the last two orders, the wrong date was given for delivery, which may be a glitch with the delivery company, but ASOS should be on top of those issues.  I placed an order for 2-day delivery, and the tracking showed that it would be another month before I received my order. The next order showed that the delivery month would be October!  In my panic and inability to contact customer service in time (needed items for multiple events) I re-placed the order, which caused double delivery close together and an unnecessary hassle and cost. ASOS, please improve your website to include customer service chat, etc.  Overall, I will continue to shop here since I love the product, but customer service needs vast improvement.

            I emailed about a faulty hoodie that I recieved, only to get a response 3 days later(which was not too much of a concern) and they said they would send me a replacement, as I had requested. Satisfied, I returned the item early the next day, including that it was faulty and that I wanted an exchange on the sheet provided. Later that same day, I recieved an ASOS package-great- except they had sent me the wrong item. I emailed again, explaining i'd been sent the wrong item but that I still wanted the replacement of the hoodie, they replied 4 days later apologising for the confusion and that they would 'definitely get this sorted' for me and send the hoodie. The next day, I got another email saying the hoodie was out of stock and to send the faulty item back- clearly they don't read any previous emails as I had already said I'd sent it back, mentioning I wanted to exchange it. Now I have to email again to ask for a refund as I don't want any other items on their site, as they suggested. Its taken over a week to sort this out and the issue is still not resolved, multiple emails have gone back and forth with a different person every time. Not what you would expect from a respected company like ASOS.

I ordered a blouse and never received the item I've been emailing customer service and I've gotten no response. I guess they just stole my money because I definitely never got my order! This boils every fiber in my body I hate when you can't even call a company and ask them about your order and when you email them you get no response they should be shut down.

            Hello, after dealing with issues with my previous orders I received this gift voucher as an apology and encouragement to continue to shop with ASOS. So, what happened?? I placed a new order a few days ago, and received my order today, the dress is a different print than what I ordered, it does not have the collar and front flap like the pic and its missing the belt; again. Please see attached pics, clearly ASOS no longer cares about delivering adequate service. I contacted ASOS Customer service and spoke with Katie, who advised me there was nothing that could be done since the dress I ordered was sold out in the size I ordered. I suggested that since the dress I received was not the correct pattern and missing a belt, could ASOS send me the correct pattern in the size 16 and as long as it had the belt attached the extra inches of fabric may not be noticeable. Katie advised she could not do that because she could only process a replacement. I have had a problem with every item I have ordered from ASOS, I believe my orders are intentionally being sabotaged, it is impossible to think that these mistakes are taking place unintentionally . I requested Katie speak with her supervisor, she advised that she spoke with Tony and was advised there was nothing which could be done.I am done with ASOS!!!!!!!Order 208101150 Item: Glamorous Belted Maxi DressI understand its not possible to remove a belt from another item to send to a customer, but the fact that i was willing to accept a size up in the item as long as the belt was attached, despite this being the incorrect print, and ASOS still refused to make this exception, shows how low this company has fallen.

            Let me tell you about ASOS. You try them out. You skeptically order one or two items to test the waters, see how that goes. They arrive in a reasonable amount of time. Those items just happen to fit, well enough anyway (miraculously). Yay! So now you have created an ASOS account and they're sending you emails. They don't offer as many discounts NEARLY as often as their competitors, like Boohoo (which I only have good things to say about and would highly recommend over ASOS a million times over). But behold, one day you get a promo code for $70 off a $250 order from ASOS! A bit much to spend, but how often does that kind of deal come around for ASOS, right? So you do it. You buy $250 worth of clothes and save $70. Yay! Then they arrive. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE there WILL BE returns that need to be made. Never have I shopped somewhere with such INCONSISTENT SIZES! This XL is smaller than that Large, but those 34"" shorts are tighter than these 28"" pants, and...you get the picture. So now, you have to send half of that big $250 order back for the correct sizes, BUT WAIT! You CAN'T exchange the items for the correct sizes? No way to do that whatsoever. You HAVE to take a refund for your returns. Now, guess what happens to that $70 discount, that you had to spend $250 just to get...it goes BYE-BYE! They take it right back out of your refund. So let's say you had to return $93 worth of clothes that didn't fit. A week or two later, they refund you $23. WHAT? WAIT! You just SCAMMED me into spending $250, just to get a $70 discount, only to have you guys TAKE IT RIGHT BACK?? I didn't want a refund IN THE FIRST PLACE! I just wanted to adjust the sizes appropriately after trying them on! I mean, if this size 30"" fits like a 34"", I guess I need a 26"", for my 32"" waist, makes perfect sense right?? Umm... Customer service, PLEASE HELP ME FIX THIS! Hahaha! ""Sorry, you should have read the Terms and Conditions."" Translation: ""Due to some fine print nobody actually reads, we don't have to make this right, so we're not going to."" Better translation: ""F*** off, we already got your money!"" Well guess what ASOS, basically everything you have to offer can be found at Boohoo or ELWOOD Clothing, among many others, for a MUCH better price. Not to mention they offer better deals and discounts WAY more often than ASOS. And I've personally needed customer service from Boohoo and they handled the issue so pleasantly, I never even had to be rude once. Anybody who reads this is going to check out those sites I just vouched for and find out for themselves they are better in every way. Maybe once you lose enough customers you'll try harder to hang on to the ones you have. That is, if you can stop being snotty little bit----, never mind, I've said my piece, no need to be ugly about it.

            I wrote 3 (!) mails to their customer service concerning my return. Nobody ever replied. As soon as they hear something they do not like, they just totally ignore you. This is very sad as I have bought a lot of stuff from them and really like the clothes they sell. I never got the money for my last return though, which I have never experienced before with other companies. Never gonna order again!!!

            Well.. They have some pretty sweet clothes. I had been shopping for my wife and stumbled across Asos. Like any good consumer, these days, I checked out their reviews. I found some really good reviews sprinkled in among some pretty horrid ones. But they had some really nice items, so I did what any guy would do, fell in my sword and bought something for myself first, just to try them out.I got something manly for about $50 and waited to see what would happen. One of the big negatives I read about was packages disappearing. Just never arriving and their tracking information would just vanish. Well, I got 4 emails about the shipping status, including one advising that the package was hung up in US Customs in Elizabeth NJ (I live in New Hampshire, US). I have to say, because of the reviews I was hitting the tracking site 10-15 times a day. To my horror, shock and amazement, my package came just as promised. Perfect shape and in this nice little shopping bag like mailer.Next concern was the quality of the product. I had read that Asos brand clothes were cheap and poorly constructed. I don't know... Maybe I got lucky, but my item is very nice. Quality material and solid construction. No loose threads or anything. I think I got a great deal at $50 (and free shipping).  In any case, I have a shopping cart full and look forward to seeing my wife in some of Asos great fashions.Do your homework and read all of the reviews, but I think Asos is the real deal. Give them a try like I did. You might be pleasantly surprised, in this world of scam every second internet retailers, that there is a good online store out there.

            First and last experience with this company.  I am an international customer currently living in Canada, wanted to return an item and tried many times to get in touch with Customer Service: email, phone and chat.  There is not such a department; a couple of weeks after emailing them and no answer.  On the phone, no matter what time during the day you call (I've tried already 9 times in the last couple of days), same.  Asos is rubbish, an absolute disaster.  I will never use it again.  If you've got a problem with the items received, no one will be there to help you in your return/refund transaction. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

            Tried to place an order with ASOS, clicked to submit order and got an error message stating couldn't process order as basket had expired (hadn't been an hour for the record) so tried again, order went through OK and goods received within couple of days.  All good.  Checking my bank however a few days later and there was 2 transactions for ASOS.  Then gets an email days after receiving order saying 'Thanks for your order'.  A duplicate of what I have already received.  The email states at the bottom, click to cancel, I did so but nowhere to do so once on site, so I email them, stating this is a duplicate order, I don't want this order and I'm not  in a position to have 2 transactions coming out my account.  Gets an email back following day saying to too late to cancel (why there should always be a telephone number) and to get back in touch when I receive the dispatch email and they'll stop it going out.  Gets dispatch email and replies back to their email.  Gets an email back stating they've notified the dispatch team (or whatever) and it'll be returned.  Then a day or so later gets another email from them about my inquiry ""chasing my order"" (I believe in my original email I was very explicit about my request) and my ""goodies"" are on their way and with me soon.  Forwarded them my previous conversation about it being returned, stating again it has to be returned.  I get an email back that they are 'pleased' my order has been successfully delivered to my selected store (I used Click and Collect).  Decided I will just go and collect and return the order. End of.  Now just received an email again from them saying they are really sorry to hear I'm still waiting for your ASOS ""goodies"" to arrive.Thing is I like ASOS stuff and when it's straightforward its all good but when I have a query the customer care team always manage to mess it up.  Last year my parcel was sent to wrong address apparently, then after about a week of going back and forth they advised they were unable to fulfill my order and had to cancel it as everything was out of stock.Hopefully ASOS will read this and acknowledge that at least staff need to read the FULL email chain or even just your email...

            I've been a customer of ASOS for years and also signed up to ASOS Premier for unlimited Next Day delivery. Me and my wife usually order things at least once a month, and in all the years I've shopped with them have only had a few orders not delivered on time, but I've found that this is usually when my items aren't delivered with DPD (ASOS use a few different couriers and not all of them are as reliable as DPD). Their returns policy is simple, they have probably the widest selection of clothes out there and their sales are great. Massive fan.:)

            Their auto-reply is to ""wait"" and thus elongate time spent on solving the problem further by not directly replying to your questions. I also hate the fact that they pass you around like a batten and you are constantly being ""helped"" by different people and therefore you end up with different replies that never really solve the problem. It has been a month since I was told I would receive my refund and I am still chasing them for it. Unless you chase them up, they will not reply back to your query even after telling you ""we will look into this"" - lies. The clothes are really poor quality and after this experience I can vouch that the customer service is even worse. If you want to save yourself the trouble and stress, do not order from them. There is also an article on VICE News about the current sweatshop like conditions people in their warehouse have to work in. Definitely never ordering with this company again.

            This must have been the worst shopping experience ever.First they advertise with free shipping, then they charge you shipping fees anyways and on top of that they do not deliver the product. The Link they send out which supposedly helps you tracking your order tells you for weeks that your order is about to reach, but it does not. After weeks I contacted customer service which simply offered me to cancel my order - without any apologies or special offers! This must be the worst service I have ever experienced.

            I used to shop of ASOS.com quite often because they offer free international shipping on all their orders. (althought it is VERY slow, Im ok with it since it is free)The plus side is that shipping has always arrived within the time period they promised, and sending back items or getting refunds are relatively quick and painless. The down side is that because they are such a huge company and their system is so mechanized, there is not much help you can get from their customer services. So when something irregular happens, it is a pain to try to communicate this problem and I got the impression that in most cases they are not willing to accomodate. In their defense I've only had that irregular thing happen once due to their server not applying my promo code on my order but in the usual cases everything is so mechanized that there is not much room to fuss over. Because they carry so many brands sizing is difficult and while their products tend to be cheaper, in my opinion it also compromises their product quality.

            I do a LOT of online shopping and it is safe to say, that ASOS by far is my favorite online shopping site. It is so easy to use, has a huge range of clothing, skincare, makeup, etc. and I love that they have video catwalks - it really helps when you have to choose a specific size.I have made a lot of orders from them the last couple of years and I have always been satisfied. Once, a package never arrived, which is obviously not their fault. The parcel was tracked and I could see where it was, and somehow it got lost in one of the sorting facilities in Denmark. However, they sent me the item again which I think is excellent service.The items have also ALWAYS arrives on time, in accordance with the estimated delivery time, which is great!The only thing that I'm kinda sad about, is the fact that I cannot buy/send nail polish to Denmark (or Faroe Islands) and I really don't understand why x)It is easy to forget to let company's know if their services are good (people tend to only post about the bad experiences), but here is my long awaited review.

            I was so happy that I managed to snag the last size in a pair of boots online, however when they came they were faulty (the material peeling back on the fastening), AND they arrived with dirty socks in them!!I messaged them on social media to complain and there resolution was to give me 10% off for next time. I explained I get this already with student discount, and they couldn't replace the boots as they were out of stock. I completely understand they can't majic boots out of no where and asked if I could have a partial refund back for the fault in the boots as I would keep them since I'm not able to get a replacement. The answer was a very RUDE keep them full price or send them back. I work in retail and we would NEVER treat our customers this way and comprimise an outcome so it benefited the customer.

            So I ordered a trainers. According to ASOS it is size UK 10.5 (on the left column) being equivalent to size EU 45. Doesn't really matter what UK size it is, as what I put with my order is in EU sizing. In my confirmation email and order record, it says EU 45. Never mentioned the UK equivalent.But what I received was a size UK 11 = EU 46 clearly stated one the trainers.It's a birthday present so I ended up placing another order (yes so that the birthday present was late), and because EU 45 is sold out I ordered EU 44.5 (UK10). It comes as “UK 10, FR 44.5”. Perfect. Glad that it still kinda fits.And I request refund plus require ASOS to pay for the postage. They said ""I've taken a closer look into this for you and checked your confirmation e-mail which shows that you have ordered a UK11 which is the equivalent to EU46, I'me managed to attach a copy of our size guide to this e-mail.""The size guide says UK11=EU46 that's true. SO?I ORDERED EU45. IF YOU CARE ABOUT UK SIZE, IT IS 10.5 ACCORDING TO THEIR TABLE. My order says I’ve ordered EU45. On these two pairs of shoes I’ve received (original order and the replacement shoes) it clearly says FR 46. I understand the difficulty in converting sizes and different design of shoes may be different. As a customer the first thing I’d like when ordering online is to receive what I’ve ordered, then even if it doesn’t fit me I’ll still be happy to exchange for another size. Some ASOS CS is nice - offered replacement with express delivery - the only problem is that it is ALSO a EU46... I did appreciated that. Some CS are rude. I sent them a long email explaining everything and they seems don't brother. I cannot stressed more that EU45 is all I've ordered so how can they still insist that I've ordered a UK11!?!?!? I spent my time giving advise, suggestion, trying to be as patient and accepting as possible. All fail. Bye ASOS.

I sent it back and tried again. I don't understand the negative comments about the customer service either. I sent a message on facebook asking about when an item would be restocked and I received a reply almost instantly. They are a huge, overseas online company, like many other clothing sites are, so of course things are bound to go wrong when massive amounts of orders are processed every day. There will ALWAYS be a risk when ordering anything from any site. You just have to cross your fingers when you click to place your order that everything will be delivered accordingly. All in all I've been happy with ASOS. I will continue to order from them :)

            Well I have been using asos for years. They use this delivery company called dpd. And for the last 2 weeks all items have been going to a different COUNTY for pick up. Once you email asos and wait for about 4-12 hours for a response from a different person each time, they will say not our problem, we cant change the delivery and it was you who did it. While i have used the premier service for years, waiting two weeks to not receive my item and then process refund is a joke

            What can I say... I ordered a lot things in the past,  that was a wonderful times, where asos can do a refund so quickly and yeasy ( for defective items).Today I got 2 of my new orders. 5 items from the orders - defective. I can't wear them !!! Horrible condition shoes, clothes  & accessories are send to me as a new ones. Ive payed for them alot of money. So, after 2 days of trying to have any answer from the asos, they said - we can make a refund after we get all these items !!! WHAT ??? And, so, ASOS, you will put all these stuff back in the shop, and the next looser like me will pay for them to got these super cool defective stuff ?????All will send back to you, ASOS, ok. But my next trouble will be - where is my money & why I can't get my money back , yea, ASOS, realy ???NEVER !!! I SAD NEVER WILL GO TO THE ASOS !!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM !!

            I've bought from quiet a long time and had good experience with it.The clothes were always good and in good quality and customer service did help me many times. They deliver overseas which is great but it takes quiet a while.However, my sister did have many problems and was banned from using the website and is very furious about it. They suddenly blocked her with no legitimate reasoning even-though she was a regular shopper.

            I was honestly so nervous about ordering from Asos after reading all of their negative reviews, but I'm so glad I did! I ordered a pair of black Arizona Birkenstocks and they arrived within 3 days (which is super fast since I live in the US). The entire time I was so paranoid that I checked the tracking status every 10 minutes, but I had nothing to worry about as they arrived long before the estimated delivery date and in perfect condition. The item was just as described and the right size, so happy; however, I will no be ordering from Asos again as I am unwilling to take another chance with this company. I'm afraid that any other future orders could be a disaster!Also, the first time I placed my order I got an email saying my card was declined! Instead of using the same one, I switched cards - just a helpful tip for those of you complaining that Asos won't accept a certain card. I hope everyone else's orders work out, best of luck!

            I've been shopping here for a couple of years. You don't know what the real customer service is until you are really in trouble.So I got this tracking email and never actually found out the tracking number and any updates.I contacted the customer service twice asking for the tracking number. Is it so hard to find out? Because they refused to tell me and they kept telling me they will look into the case if I can't get the order on the expected delivery date.So that day came. In the morning I received the email saying my order has been returned and the refund has been issued.I was like "" WHAT THE F**K""..----There was a promotion when I placed the order. And I used the promo code to save AU$50 for order over AU$$200. After the order is returned bizarrely, you know, I never receive it.I contacted the customer service, they issued me a code, the same code.But the problem is one item in my order has been out of stock. So if I re-place the order, the order will be under AU$200. So the code is useless.I wouldn't want to buy other stuff to make the order above AU$200. Why should I? I ask them to give me a promo code for my new order under AU$200 or extend the expiry date of the code because I want to see if others will return this out-of-stock item. They just couldn't negotiate. I mean what the hell is wrong with them? It is their mistake. I should have got my order with all items. But instead of this, their mistake made my order go back to them and one item is even out of stock.To be honest, right now I don't know who to complain. I think the whole company is a piece of crap.Those customer service staff has supervisors. Their service is guided by their upper level.Whatever, Here it is, my experience. I have 30 or 40 happy orders, but only 1 bad order is enough.Cross your fingers and pray that your order will be good.Cross your fingers.

            I bought a £135 purse for my wife on 9/4/16 for her birthday on the 6/5/16. Up to the 20/4/16 I didn't get the product delivered. Apart from the confirmation email I got the same day I didn't receive any emails. So on the 20/4/16 I email Asos asking where my purchase was. I got this email: ""Hi Adam,Thank you for getting in touch with us about your order xxxxxxxx - I'm really sorry to hear that your parcel hasn't reached you.I've looked into this and can see that there was an issue whilst your parcel was in transit with Hermes and it has been returned back to us due to the parcel being damaged.I know this wasn't the news you hoped to hear Adam and hope that no inconveniences have been caused.Here at ASOS we really do value our much loved customers such as yourself and aim to deliver the best service each and every time, but I completely understand that on this occasion this hasn't been the case.I can see that Hermes initiated the return on 13th April, so please allow a further 2 working days for the parcel to reach back at our warehouse and for the return to be processed.As soon as it's been received by 25th April latest, we'll send you an e-mail to let you know we've got the parcel. It'll then take up to 5 working days (excluding weekends) for the money to appear back in your account, depending on your card issuer/bank.I'm sorry your order wasn't received on this rare occasion Adam - if you have any other questions please let me know; I'll be here and happy to help you.Best Wishes,xxxxxx""So they damaged the packaging for a purse so badly it couldn't be delivered and they are refunding my money (not before they get it back from the courier) and I had no clue what was going on until I contacted Asos. What I don't get now is when the package was sent to courier damaged and they decided to send it back, why didn't Asos process the refund then? Why are they making me wait for their internal processes? I now have to wait for my refund to be processed on the 25/4/16 then wait 5 days for the bank to clear it.Asos probably do care about their customers up to the point there is an error or issue at which point they don't and they put their own processes before their customers. Also when a customer contacts them they use a cut and paste email to respond. I will not be shopping with this company again!

            I gave 1 star because I had to. I bought 2 jackets, they sent me a 10% of my first purchase and I used that. 1 of the jackets was listed at $39 on sale, and when I checked out the jacket was $79. I took a snapshot of the jacket displaying the price, they told me they would reimburseme when I received the order.I didn't received my order for over a month because. And my jacket I order for $39 wasn't included because now it was out of stock.However the jacket I did receive was not the best quality and wasn't worth it.I have snapshots and FB messages of all the process I went though in order to receive this order.  I have never given a bad review to anyone, but you should all be aware. This company has to much work to do to get to a level of the prices they are charging for the quality of clothes and for all the nonsense they put me through. I could send this jacket back as I just received it yesterday and ordered on March 3rd 2016.This is my first time and last time.

            I don't care what any good review says. Your chances of getting a ""good"" experience with this website is about 15%. I've read so many reviews on this website on whether or not to buy two shirts. I went with my gut and hoped that I would get my shirts on time. I ordered two pairs of shirts about 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to come April 11th, as said on the email they sent me to confirm my order. But it still hasn't come and I am BEYOND furious. Don't trust this stupid website. I am never going to buy from here again. Believe me guys, even if you see really nice clothing, don't buy it - even if it is cheap. You'll just get ripped off and you won't even get the items you want. Never am I touching this website again.

            I've been shopping at ASOS for about a year now without a single problem except for their sizes being kinda wacky sometimes, but my orders always came on time and in good shape until my last recent order, which was supposed to be here Friday 4/15, which also did not come with tracking. I contacted them over the weekend and all they told me was to wait til 4/25 for my order to come in case of ""delivery delays"". Long story short, it's only 4/19 but from the reviews and stories I've read about this same situation happening to others, I have a feeling I won't be seeing my order or a refund for a very long time or at all.

            I have been shopping at ASOS for a couple of years. I have been happy with the products, the prices and the quality. Fortunately i have not been in contact with their support, until now. I will try to keep the story short. A couple of weeks ago I decided that I needed new shoes and some other clothes for spring and so i went to ASOS.com. While browsing the site i noticed that they had a promo code which gave me the following:* 150 SEK off a purchase of 1000SEK-1499SEK* 250 SEK off a purchase of 1500SEK - 1999SEK* and so on. I went ahead and placed an order of about 1750 SEK which gave me the right to use the promo code which gave me 250 SEK discount. Five days later i went to fetch the order and the postal office, I tried the clothes on and noticed that the belt and the trousers didn't fit as well i thought it would. As ASOS has free returns I simple went ahead and returned the items which didn't fit. The returned items were worth 100 + 250 SEK.About a week later I recieved an email stating that I would get 100 SEK back of total 350 SEK. This means that my promo code was gone and I had to pay 250 SEK extra. I e-mailed back asking why i didn't get the whole 350 SEK back and got the answer that by returning these items the total value of the order was no longer more than 1500 SEK which meant that the promo code stopped working. I actually think this is right but as you see above, there is a code for orders with sums between 1000 SEK and 1500 SEK. So i asked why that promo code wasn't applied instead. The answer from the support was that it doesn't work like that because the promo code is no longer usable. About now i started to get frustrated. 1. ASOS wasn't willing to apply the smaller discount because of no reason at all.2. If I only had returned the belt for 100SEK i wouldn't had gone under 1500SEK, thus keeping my original discount.3. By returning the belt AND the trousers, thus loosing the discount, I actually GAVE the trousers back to ASOS and the same time paid for them. I went ahead and informed the ""support"" about this and i didn't get any answer at all. So I tried asking to get the trousers back, becasue they were in my opinion still mine because I actually paid for them by returning them, as stupid as it may sound. The answer was that they couldn't send them back as the refund was already processed. They actually processed the return before the matter at hand was solved. You wanna know what I got as an ""Im sorry"" from ASOS? I got the same discount code again and it's viable until 24/4 2016. Which is 5 days from now. Do you think I will use it?ASOS support is a joke. Before this experience I would recommend ASOS to anyone. Now I wont recommend it anymore to anyone.I wonder if ASOS now how much they loose from scr*wing with the customers over petty sums. Just help the customer and you get good PR, thus more customers. (Will post this to all known review-sites to let customers how ASOS treats their customers)

            I am absolutely disgusted by ASOS I dont know if they have been taken over by another manager or what but their services have gone down hill and after seeing all the reviews on here I can see I am not alone on this matter.I have been an ASOS customer forever it seems and a premier account holder I travel a lot so tend to online shop on a regular basis and more frequently so this past 6-8 months. on several occasions they have sent me incorrect items. these problems CONSISTENTLY happened in the space of 2 months back to back and ASOS refused to take responsibility for their mistakesNot only that but the quality control process is a disgrace on several occasions I have had dresses and Nike bras & other tops arrive inside out with deodorant marks and dead skin attached. I took pictures of all of this as from past problems I have noticed that they do not accept responsibility for any of their mistakes and like to make me feel like i am lying.In addition to this I have had to make several complaints re refund where they will either refund me incorrectly, or not even refund me at all-  despite the proper paper work included in the returns they consistently got it wrong.I have just sent a returns via collect plus sent them all the proofs and received an email stating as I am having this problem again they are banning me from making purchases and not refunding me.As a whole this company is a disgrace. They have messed with the wrong customer as I am now going to take it even further and contact the ombudsmen and I think everyone else who is having this problem should do too. I will also be making charge backs via my bank.This is borderline thievery and I will not allow this to go lightly.  So beware of this company and be sure to take pictures of everything as they REFUSE to take any responsibility.Make sure you send by collect plus method ONLY as HERMES do not give you receipt on collection which could elongate the process should you be having the same problems.where possible avoid this company - I order on Zalando who are based in Germany has better quality garments and millions of brands and exceptional service and Items arrive within few days. Prompt refunds and 100 day returns.

I emailed back and forth with customer service, who replied the same or next day each time. I finally was able to order my suit and it only took 2 weeks to get to America. The quality is top notch and I'm super happy. The only thing I can recommend is to get pants slightly longer than normal, unless you want that, ankle exposed high water look..

            I have to say that I was very loyal to ASOS. When I did my taxes I had spent thousands of dollars with them. I sent them hundreds of new customers. I had trust. This time was different. I ordered products from ASOS and spent a decent amount over $500.  UPS lost the package  (which took 3 days to determine) and so began the run around from ASOS! They are fully aware that the package is lost. They communicate slowly and without emotion. They refuse to refund me and keep telling me to be patient. Easy because they already have my money. So now I am obligated to be patient. This is the worst customer service and lack of value for their brand. I have been in contact communication via twitter I won't stop until I have my refund and they make this right. I will then start direct messaging all the bloggers and fashion tweeters I am in contact with so they know exactly what they are supporting. What a HORRIBLE company. In 2016 I am just completely in shock that they lack the #1 ticket to success...value of the customer.

            Trying to get hold of someone is very painful, the chat is never working, due to it being busy,so it says on the website,  there is no phone numbers either, asking a question is painful too as sometimes your option isn't listed.

            Since end 2015 beginning 2016 Asos began sending me white clothes with huge yellow stains, shoes with crumpled straps (apparently used before), wrong items (they just chuck some random item instead of the one I ordered), and I've also experienced missing order and they asked me to wait a month and then another one more week before they grudgingly gave my refund.They REFUSED to replace the stained clothes, refused to give me the correct items. Instead they asked me to mail back the faulty stained wrong goods and said they will only Refund me when they get their dirty stuff back??!?They also were very patronizing and said ""I'm so sorry you didn't like the dress you received"".Are they nuts? Who would like a dress with a huge yellow dodgey stain on it? Or shoes that'd been worn before? Or a completely wrong item??

            Asos are clearly being very stingy when it comes to customer service and shipping the task offshore and having it all done via email and Twitter.The responses received to queries are absolutely appalling. It's clear to see the 'advisor' is sticking to a script and not using their common sense to help out.I made an order which they said the courier 'lost' and they didn't refund me for about 3 weeks and were so unhelpful. The items were for 2 weddings I had that week and ended up without the items. They even had the cheek to send me to links to similar items 3 times the price to order instead.

            I have been shopping at ASOS for a year and a half now. I love the selection of clothes. They have cheap stuff, and very expensive stuff so it's for everybody. I order from them between 1-2 a month. I always end up having to return something (I don't mind). The process is easy, normally takes less than a week. I have premier on my account, so items come within two days !! Overall, i really like it and would recommend it

            I have been an asos customer for years and always buy a year long premier delivery pass as I get a lot of clothes from them. I bought a pair of trousers from them and have worn them only twice and some stitching has come undone, I emailed them regarding this thinking that they would replace only to be told that any items over 6 months old were not covered by them for manufacturing faults. The trousers were exactly 6 months old to the day that I emailed them about the fault but they are unwilling to do anything about it which I think is terrible customer service, all the big companies out there offer a 12 month guarantee on products so it really is very bad customer service that asos don't. My love of all thing asos is now over and as you can buy most of the products on the site direct from the manufacturer either on the high street or they're own website which is what I will do as they offer a 12 month guarantee.

They keep sending me wrong items. the worst thing is their ‘’customer service‘’, had to wait for 2 days to get their answer by email which was not helpful. Returning  was not an easy thing!! 28 working days after I returned the wrong items ,I still hadn't received any email telling they had received the package, neither got my refund. I contacted with them, then they asked me to show some proof.but the postage receipt didn't show the postage cost, then I had to show them with my creditcard records to prove how much I paid.This time they sent a wrong top again, I havn't got any email from their customer service yet!

            I would like everybody to be aware of the terrible customer service of ASOS. For myself personally, I have made the decision to never ever place an order at this website again. The reason for this is the fact that I have experienced the most misleading customer service ever. I will explain you guys what happened:I saw a pop-up ad on Facebook for a blue shirt and I liked it so I decides to order one but I accidently forgot to select the size and therefore in my order the size S was automatically selected. I know from previous orders that ASOS always tell that with the Standard delivery method, it's possible to cancel your order within one hour. Reasonable deal, that's what I thought in the first place. But then I actually wanted to cancel my order. I went to my placed orders but there was not a ""Cancel"" button at all. I am 100% sure that my order was placed under the Standard delivery method. When I tried to contact the customer service, I firstly had to wait at least 10 minutes before the ""Live Chat"" became available. When I finally got to speak to an employee of ASOS she first wanted to know all details of my orders (order nr., name, birth date et cetera). She responded very very slow and wouldn't believe my complaint that there was no ""Cancel"" button. It truly costed me more than one and a half hour to communicate with this woman and the result of the conversation was only a transcript of the terrible chat in my mail box... In the end I sent the order back after it arrived at my house and I will get my refund but my problem is the way they are handling problems of customers. It literally takes 150 times as long to cancel an order compared to the time and easiness of placing an order. I actually get sick from it...Thanks,Martijn Strijp

I've been shopping with them for over 5 years now, and have found the returns process easy, clothes arrive on time and are of decent quality.I've had instances where I need to contact their team to sort out an order, and they've always bent over backwards to assist.

            I can not believe how terrible this companies customer service is. I tried to order twice through ASOS. My orders were rejected both times although my card details were authorised and the money was suspended in my account as 'authorisations pledged'. I contacted my bank, who told me that my card details were obviously fine and everything was fine on their end. I then contacted ASOS and received the most frustrating, dismissive emails in response. The first email I received (from a Jodie) told me to 'check my card details are correct, detail your cookies and try again'. I was also told that they could not authorise NAB (their bank) to release the funds back to me, and that I would have to call their bank myself and ask them to release the funds and that their was nothing else they could do. Right... because I'm sure that NAB would have released my funds, and not just laughed at me.I replied that this was not good enough, and that I was sure my card details were correct as I had the money pledged from my account (which they already knew). I also told them that I would not be deleting my cookies and re-ordering, as they couldn't tell me why my orders were rejected, and apparently it was then my problem to chase up my money from their stuff up.ASOS responded again, calling me Jodie (not my name, but the name of the first customer service rep) and telling me again that there was nothing they could do and the problem was 100% with my bank.I wanted to give ASOS my money, and they didn't want to help me work out what the issue with the order was, or help me get my money back. Telling a customer that it's their problem to chase up, when it's clearly an issue on your end is a sure way to tick people off. And if that didn't do the trick, then sending them an email with the wrong person's name in it is definitely the icing on the cake.ASOS, lift your game. I will never order from your site again, and I hope I was a one off with this dreadful service, or you will lose plenty more customers.

            I have been shopping at ASOS.com for over 5 years now and have only had one bad experience. The items I have received are always true to size and great quality. The prices have gone up lately but they always have good sales. I prefer ASOS over other sites because their styles are on trend and they are constantly receiving new items so there is always a lot to choose from. They also have variety. I have shopped there for my single, vegas-vacation days and now for my bridal shower...I did recently get a dress that I was totally disappointed by - the material was foamy and the hem was unfinished and uneven - just bad! Thankfully they are GREAT with returns.  Overall, I love ASOS.com and hope others can enjoy them too.

            ASOS has some cute clothing items but the customer service is not worth it. Their customer service mainly communicates via social media- i.e. Facebook, Twitter. If you do not have a social media account, you are basically screwed.  I've tried emailing them multiple times in reference to a package I never received (and which I never received a tracking number for), and they only gave a generic, unhelpful response. You're better off going to boohoo.com which has cute clothing and amazing customer service.

And then I keep getting told to ""email back in a few days"" ""it can take 8 working days to receive and process a refund"" IT'S BEEN 8 DAYS! Stop trying to fob me off! I will be putting in a complaint with trading standards next week. It's not on.

            They are quick enough to take your money but after that they couldnt care less. I purchased an item and after it being said that it would be delivered in a certain time period it was not. After waiting ten days since i placed the order i contacted asos directly only to be told that there was a ""problem with the courier service"" and i would have to wait a further four days for the item. I certainly did not expect to wait two weeks and would of prefered if they informed me to tell me about the glitch instead i was mistreated. Considering i am loyal customer and regularly purchase from asos i would of thought i would of been treated better especially when you pay a decent amount of money for the items. Im sorry to say but you have lost a valuable customer and i will not be shopping with you again.

            I have been ordering from ASOS for years and never had a bad experience until for some reason, their courier and USPS didn't connect or for some reason, I didn't receive my package. I got in touch with customer service and over 2 weeks went by with their customer service telling me to get in touch with USPS, which I did each time they recommended it. BUT it seems like they have no other solution! I even asked - what happens when I don't receive this package? What's the next solution? I followed their advice each time, and still didn't get my goods. And they didn't seem to care that I (a) was out almost $100 (b) wasn't having a good experience with their brand (c) didn't receive my order, probably will never receive it or my money back. I'm SO disappointed that I put them on blast on Twitter, and they were responsive for awhile, but now they probably think I'm a nut-job. BUT their service has been so atrocious that I felt I had no choice. Another thing that bugged me about the customer service experience was that I tried the chat option once and the CS rep just ended the conversation without the usual ""is there anything else I can help with"" but rather said something like, ""this is what we have to offer and please email us with any further inquiry"". I get the sense that ASOS has changed their customer care policy (and maybe even US courier)? To save money / be more profitable. They're clearly doing the most they can to keep people from reuniting with their money AND this courier SUCKS. I used to work at a corporate retailer (who's no longer in business) who used to do similar cost cutting methods. Good grief!!!

            I highly do not recommend ordering from asos. First and for most they do not have a call line for assistance which should have been a red flag, but I ordered anyways. My shipment contained a couple hundred dollars worth and the package was never received. I am from the U.S. so it is possible that they do not have proper contracts for missing packaged with post offices in the U.S. Their website for customer service was not easy to navigate, nor was it useful. I received a response from Georgina that  stated ""we have no further need to look into this for you"". Outch! I was questionable about ordering from this website and I regret not going with my gut and shopping somewhere else.  I am writing this so that others don't have the same dilemma I did. I feel robbed!

            I purchased the crepe pencil dress with know detail in colour blush for £45. I never ever spend that much money but honestly the dress was beautiful. Their sizes are quite generous but this was a perfect fit. Free delivery, free returns, fast replys if you need any help. Overall an amazing site I use all the time :)WARNINGprettylittlething.com is a scamming website. I'm making people aware. Take a look at their reveiws. most off their reveiws are 1 start and over half their 5 star reveiws the company has written themselves. If you don't believe me look for yourself.

            They provide fast shipping and have super cute stylish clothes.  There was only one time that they took a while to ship, and that was 2 years ago around Christmas time. So it's understandable. Other then that, they ship pretty fast. I live in California and receive my items in 3 days top. Customer service is great and always answers your questions fast.

            I've ordered (and returned) ASOS items many times over the past couple of years, and I have never had a problem with either the quality of their items, or the quality of the customer service.Returns have always been processed quickly, have nothing bad to say about them. Would definitely recommend. They seem to have a lot of bad reviews on here, which I don't understand, but I suppose that with a big company there will always be people who are unhappy!

            I ordered a coat from Asos for my birthday just over a month ago. The item never arrived despite showing as delivered on the couriers website. After numerous emails they eventually sent out a replacement coat which I received to then find that it had already been worn and also items in the pockets! The tags were also removed from the coat and the returns label wasn't included which meant I couldn't return the coat or get a refund. Utterly disappointed and I won't be ordering from them again.

            I have ordered from them a few times, clothes and shoes once. Shoes were nice and comfy, fit me perfectly. But there is an isuue with clothes.I ordered them a few times and it never looked like on the pictures or even catwalk (is the video retouched too?). Fabrics looks always different than in the picture. I ordered a few times and had to send back all clothes! It doesn't happen to me so often with other websites. I order from New Look and different brands and it is great most of the time.I do not know, if their clothes are so retouched but I was never happy with what I saw :-(.I wish I bought a single clothes from them as I think, they ship quickly and their service is good in general. I need to give up with shopping there...

            Asos is good for some things. There is an excellent selection of own brand and branded clothing. Some items are of very low quality however despite a premium price, I've lost buttons on day one, had seams that aren't fit for purpose and just had items that come and the material is clearly budget, even when paying a lot. They have a reasonable returns policy, there is nothing to pay, everything can go back in it's original packaging for a full refund. Unfortunately, this is where the good experience stops. Delivery is hit and miss, I live in London so we're used to decent delivery experience and for me it's an incredibly important part of the sales process. Home Deliveries are usually ok, you get a 1 hour delivery window which is very useful. However, delivery to stores is abysmal. I've used the service a few times and it's yet to work out for me. I appreciate that ASOS have no control over the stores but they should absolutely check them out before using them. If something goes wrong with an order, that's where the problems really start. Customer service speak like 12 year olds in class. Or at least that's how they are trying to come across. If you're looking for a cheap pair of jeans and don't mind too much when they arrive, the store can be of use. However you really could end up on the end of one of the most frustrating customer service experiences possible. So ask yourself, is it worth it?

            I've used asos quite a lot for my daughter, clothes are lovely quality, delivery and exchange brilliant, but most of all I wanted to leave a review for their customer service which is absolutely excellent. I bought a dress for my daughter as a surprise and by the time she received it and decided she wasn't sure and it was far too long for her, it was out of the 28 day return. Asos were so helpful, let me return the dress free of charge and gave me a speedy refund. Professional company, with excellent customer service would highly recommend, and will continue to use.

            I love the clothes that the brand delivers, BUT, they serve horrible shipping services, horrible customer service with no telephone service, and sometimes lacking quality in their clothing. I am terrified each time I order from here from fear of needing to start a case for missing items, or dealing with OVERPRICED customs from UPS. UPS is the MOTHER of HORRIBLE customer service.

            I paid for the unlimited next day delivery and last Friday I ordered two items and were supposed to get them both the day after. But ASOS ""brilliantly"" gave one parcel to Hermes and one to DPD and so on Saturday I got two emails from the two couriers about the delivery. While DPD (as always) gave me the one hour window so I could make sure I wouldn't miss the delivery even if I wanted to go out before the delivery time, Hermes only told me that the parcel would be delivered on the day which means that they expected me to stay at home all day on Saturday to wait for a parcel. I had a quick supermarket trip and when I came home I saw a card left by Hermes with only the word ""Monday"" on the card. No matter on the card or on their website there was totally NO WAY I could contact them to rearrange a delivery. So I stayed at home ALL DAY on Monday to wait for the parcel. It never arrived. A whole day wasted and hey I paid for next day delivery and the parcel should have been with me on Saturday! Contacted ASOS saying I didn't want the parcel anymore since it was late and I didn't want to stay at home for another day to wait for a parcel which no one could guarantee whether it would arrive or not. Quickly got a reply saying they had asked Hermes to send the parcel back to ASOS warehouse and a refund would be given to me afterwards. A few hours later I got another reply from another ASOS staff saying they had checked with Hermes and the item would be redelivered to me. I was so annoyed and replied to ask them to check again. Then I got a reply saying they misread my email and they definitely had asked Hermes to return my parcel to ASOS so to process a refund.Two days later which is today Hermes sent me an email in the morning saying they would deliver my parcel!!! What's going on? No choice but had to contact ASOS asking why and they said they called Hermes to confirm and the parcel would definitely be sent back to ASOS. Only 10 MINUTES later I got a text from Hermes saying the parcel would be delivered today before 4pm!!!! Once again I had to ask ASOS and they said they had no control whether Hermes drivers got the instruction or not so if the parcel arrived I could SIMPLY return it. Great! Is that what customer service is? They obviously don't care customers. ASOS took my money but they NEVER helped solve the problem but instead causing more confusions and frustrations and now they just expect me to make a special trip only to return a late parcel?! I even got an email from ASOS asking me to comment on their customer service! It said ""I really hope I resolved you query""! Are you joking?PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHOP. It will just waste your time.

Completely ruined my weekend, and now I'm being made to walk miles to pick the item up. All asos can do is say sorry?!! How about sorry for ruining your weekend, sorry that you're paying for asos premier and now have to pick up your own parcels! If I buy from an online retailer I expect it to be delivered to my home. After telling them I won't be purchasing from them again even though I've been a customer since they first started business they were not even bothered.

            A couple of weeks ago I ordered a beautiful dress from Asos, but received a horrible top instead. They told me on the chat that they would send a replacement, but it never happened! After contacting them 4 times on the chat, where they all told me different thing and lied to me, I finally asked to speak to a manager. They told me that I would receive a call within 24 hours, which of course never happened either!! I am not gonna bother sending the item back because it is going to cost me half the price of the ""dress"" and I am pretty certain with their trackrecord now, that they wont return the cost anyway. I would not recommend anyone to shop with them online, as there are so many better and reliable sites to use.I can also see that ASOS isnt replying to any of these trustpilot messages, which is also totally unacceptable!

            They seem great until you need customer service...my package did not arrive, apparently lost in shipping, and they repeatedly gave me the run-around, put me off (my guess is hoping I'd go away). They claimed they couldn't trace the package because it had no tracking number, then said they were ""investigating"" what happened to it. I'd like to know how they can ""investigate"" with no tracking number. Nice clothes, but trying to get a refund or replacement is not worth the hassle of ordering from them. Too many other sites that offer real customer service. I reported them to the Better Business Bureau and my credit card company was decent enough to credit me for the loss ASOS caused.

            I received my package today that I tried to cancel but you said that I could just easily return it when it arrives. What you didn't tell me was that I would have to pay over 25 euros for this return from Finland. Especially as a student I will not pay that kind of fee for one return of two products. Now I remember again why I haven't ordered anything from you in a long time..

            I ordered there a few of times. The shipment was fast, the customer service ok, but I was disappointed with most of the items. The quality was so so and then I had to bother sending back the items... Put aside the fact that I actually had to pay importation taxes that were more expensive that the items I ended up buying. They did refund me for the items I sent back pretty fast. I like going around the website to see the pictures and inspiration, but I'm not buying there anymore. It's too much of a hassle.

            Customer care is really key when it comes to running a succesfull business! What does it help to have a good brand, nice website, good prices, etc, if in the end the customer is left unsatisfied? I purchased a coat from the website ASOS on friday. I paid DKK 100 extra for express delivery (day after delivery) because I want to receive the coat as soon as possible and before I leave for Brussels on Wednesday. I've been tracking the package on DHL's website the entire weekend (yes, I am THAT excited about  a damn coat), and the entire weekend it looked like it was in Germany still. Today when I checked it was the same story so I called DHL and they informed me that indeed the package is still in Germany and I will most likely not receive it today :O I mean, when a customer actually pays extra to receive the package faster, and it says on the order confirmation that it will be delivered on Monday, February 22, between 7 am and 10 pm - how can you still have the package not dispatched from Germany on that same day???? To top it off, I did not find any telephone number to which I could call to clarify this, so had to settle for an email adress. I mean c'mon, how can you, as an online store, not have a number to which customers can call to receive rapid feedback/answers to their queries? Maybe I will still receive my coat today, but that is not likely to happen. If it does, it still has caused me frustration and I am not likely to come back to shopping with ASOS ever again.

            My first order from this website was a dress for my sister's wedding. It was easy to place and I received a confirmation email right away. I received a shipping confirmation a couple days later with tracking #. The next day I received a follow up e-mail letting me know the shipment might be a few days late due to poor weather on the east coast. I periodically checked the tracking # to see it's progress or get an estimated arrival date. The only information available I could see was that it had been dispatched from their warehouse. About 8 days after I initially placed the order, I received an email saying my order had been successfully returned to ASOS and my money would be refunded in 8-10 days. I contacted ASOS through their chat window (there is NO phone number to call, all communication is via chat or email, which is very frustrating) and asked how my ordered had been returned when I never received it in the first place. The rep was somewhat helpful, and after some digging said my order had never made it out of the warehouse and was accidentally returned before it shipped. So I guess the tracking # was bogus the whole time. I asked if they could cancel the return and just send the dress out, and she said no. I would have to reorder the dress and repay while waiting to get my refund back. I decided to just go ahead and reorder it because I really loved the dress. I went to purchase, and the website said my size was out of stock. I opened the chat once again, got a different rep who was absolutely zero help and kind of an jerk. I let them know what happened, and asked if they could assist me because I knew there was at least ONE dress in my size available, it had been returned to their warehouse and was the one I had already paid for once. He said there was nothing they could do, I would just have to watch the website to see if it got updated (they couldn't send me any email alert), then he said there was a size 10 available to ship. A size 10 isn't very close to a size 4, but thanks. I was eventually refunded my money, and I ended up finding a different dress from a trusted retailer.After I ordered the dress, I placed a separate order for a bathing suit a day later. I was sent a shipping confirmation that said there was no tracking # available, but it should arrive by Feb 3rd. On Feb 5th when i did not received the package, I messaged ASOS and was told I should allow for an additional week in case of shipping delays. After that week, I messaged ASOS again and they asked me to check with my neighbors and anywhere else it could've been delivered, though they could not actually verify if it had been delivered or not. I let them know NO packages had been delivered to me, and was told they would investigate and get back to me in a couple of days. The next day i received an e-mail saying the original package had been lost, but they'd send me a new order via UPS express with tracking # at no expense. I received the bathing suit yesterday as promised.Basically, I would use this company at your own risk and only for inexpensive items. Also don't order anything you need right away, because if you do get it it's probably not going to be in the original time frame they said.

            Ordered an item from ASOS on the 2nd of February for international delivery (Europe) and received an email saying it had been dispatched on the 2nd and should expect it around the 11th but to wait until the 16th. The postal service here are very good at leaving slips incase noone was home and will take it back out for delivery the next day then leave it in the post office for a few more days.I have contacted ASOS but now been told to wait until the 27th.Reading other reviews quite disappointed as it seems like another 'phantom parcel' that has gone MIA.

            I use Asos quite a bit just because the range in stock is a lot wider than most of the competition.The delivery options are pretty good (especially if you have the Prime equivalent) and it is also very easy to return items that do not fit or you just don't like.My only gripe is that the product size charts are very generic and don't always match reality. I also received an item that had clearly been returned by another customer and hadn't been repackaged properly (I really shouldn't be able to tell).

Why take my order, charge me for delivery and send the wrong size, there is a reason we order the CORRECT SIZES! Please DO NOT  reply with "" contact our customer service team and we will look into this for you"", already done that. Why cant large corporations just be honest??!

            I understand this company receives thousands upon thousands of orders within a week. My order was returned to sender without any notice. Not a problem, its hard to keep track of thousands of orders, especially when they are being shipped through USPS, I do not expect special treatment. However, after notifying that my package was RTS, they did not have the option to reship the order, which again I was fine with, but it was stated that my order which I did not receive, needed to return to their warehouse before I received any sort of refund. Considering I never received the order, that should be a wash. Its been 20 business days since I inquired with this issue. No resolution. Also if your going to out source your customer service to India, you may want to consider training your employees to be able to meet the needs of your customers, the same generic response would work better with a scripted bot. I am sure when all goes well, its great but if a bump happens expect the run around. I am out 75 dollars, I don't really expect it back either, hopefully they have a good Chargeback team.

            I ordered a dress for Christmas season and it arrived a whole month later than ASOS' ETA. Had to scramble to find something to wear for holiday parties. That's bad already, but what's really bad is paying postage for return of the item, checking with them another month later to find out they didn't get it. Apparently this happens a lot with ASOS, no idea why a big company won't take any time to fix their issues. So I can't get a refund because I don't have the postage receipt anymore and that's that. Not to mention I had to go through a string of different people via email to get all of this amazing help because they just don't let you call. Not sketchy at all. Suffice to say ASOS will never get another cent from me.

As the customer I am not that important, as a potential new customer I am not that important.I contacted customer service by way of chat, and when I asked that they contact the dept handling my case, they said no.  And then hung up on me.  Just like that:Me: I'm not worried. I got her bending my ear. I sent this last night, and then followed up early this morning with more information. Can you give me a time?Michael: Haha! We're not able to give an exact timeframe, but we'll get back to you ASAP so you can treat your fiance to her dressMe: No, so I can be relieved.

            ASOS are useless if anything goes wrong.

            This has been a real joke of an experience with this company. I've reviewed their stock the past couple of years and never actually bought anything, as I do not often shop online. Finally a couple days ago I spent a good few hours picking out a lovely little mix of things in my exact sizes on sale, it was supposed to be a self-treat to celebrate a new job.I sent the order and went to work thinking about my fair-deals arriving, got home and found an e-mail 'Oups!' we've cancelled your order! WHAT? you are suspicious - (huh? why?) send us your most private bank statements, copy of passport, etc, and we'll think about letting you join our very exclusive club (well they more or less said that). Needless to say, I'm definitely not cool enough for ASOS. I called the (disgustingly useless) customer service number, and was told that none of those items would be reserved, and that I would have to wait 48 hours for an (automated) response. Bull Sh**^Oi45o682096829405869024586t. (excessive I know ^, but it goes on) So I wrote to ASOS, after first sending all those PRIVATE documents, obviously a bit flustered (though I can confirm, still polite - i know to keep my cool, but ugh I've lost it now)...explaining why I was flustered, namely the fact that they are NON-contactable (except by e-mails ...which all seem automated as well), and that this whole situation of waiting 48 hours when I had paid originally for 24 hour expedited shipping (which ultimately I was not charged in lieu of cancellation, but it is the idea that I made my order with the need of receiving it quickly). I asked if someone could respond to me more quickly. And someone did. Quite cynically and vulgarly might I add. Faye. damn you. and Ramana too (who later reiterated Faye's words in a soulless identical response to a rather poetic effort made to contact them via Facebook. f&P%@^@$%^ck.)

And I was not, am not, will not, ever be accepted in the club. Now you might say - make a different e-mail. Called customer service, informed me that doing so will not work - they will delete that account, and anything attached with my name, my address, my bank card. So then, in last resort to find a ticket to the party, my mother created an account with her name, her details, ordered me a couple of my things - said here baby be my valentine, feel good about yourself in some nice new clothes. She makes the delivery address mine, but addressed to my boyfriend, just so that the puppies won't start huffing like crazy. Wakes up, new e-mail, ASOS 'Oups! we've cancelled your order.' etc etc etc or basically, 'hey mama-cow don't know if it wasn't clear before but if your baby's milk is polluted that means your's is too and we ain't making no mcFlurries with that shiiiiiiiiiii928456908t so gets on outta here.

            The store has an annoying habit of displaying photoshopped pictures of items and clothes worn. The lighting can change the feel of the material, and loose parts of a dress are concealed through not always such careful retouching. The worst part here is that although you already are disappointed when you get an item/items that don't match your expectations, ASOS make you pay for returning items. This fact they hide from plain sight, which means you have to download your countries return pdf:s in order for this information to be revealed. This can be classified as false marketing, as they insinuate that returning only requires packing your items, tagging and filling out a report and then taking the parcel to a local post office. As most professional online shops are smart enough to understand that free returns ensure happier and more likely returning customers, the fact that ASOS is not interested in it's customer's satisfaction, may go unnoticed before it is too late.

            Best experience from an online retailer I've ever had. Order a £16 watch, got home to find my gate lying down horizontally in my back garden and the watch delivered in our recycle bin. Cost me £250 to have the gate repaired. Followed their protocol dealt with them not Hermes. 1.	Asked me for a statement.2.	Asked me to email pictures.3.	Asked me to get 3rd party quote.4.	Asked me to wait while Hermes responded.5.	A Hermes delivery driver appeared at my front door when I was at work, my wife answered and found his demeanour threatening. Informed ASOS of this and they stated this was standard practice. BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE A SINGLE WOMAN LIVING ON YOUR OWN!! 6.	ASOS asked what evidence I had Hermes had done it, I stated has much evidence that they had they hadn’t.ASOS then stated nothing to do with them and they would be doing nothing for me.An update for reviewers who stated I should have taken the complaint direct to the delivery company not ASOS. This emailed received today.""I can confirm that all courier complaints would need to be handled by ourselves as unfortunately the courier would be unable to handle your complaint if you contact them directly. We therefore work with the courier to investigate the issue on your behalf.

Not sure what the customer service is like as I have never had to use it and I have ordered hundreds of times over the past few years. Products are also great for me.

            I used to like ASOS and they was fairly reliable.But over the last year or so they have been poor, a few months back I ordered a Jacket which when received was used.And recently they cannot get the order right twice I have been sent the wrong sizes, their customer service is useless, with pointless backwards and forwards emails which they take ages to answer and is a different person every time.Their prices may be good, but is it really worth the grief, you will, not might get.Do yourself a favour and shop elsewhere

            These guys lack of proffesionalism is outrageous!  They sent my express delivery order in two parcels. One parcel arrived after a week delay, after over 15 emails, several online chat disscusion. From 5 items at least 3 didnt match the products color/size/fabric! The second parcel looks like is lost.  They dont have a tracking no, nor they can say if it is shipped. Their agents keep apologizing and tell me to be patient that they will get back with info in 48 hours.  After the 48 pass they asked me to wait another 48 hours!!! So they get back to me with no helping info! They dont even refund the transport for the items that are not similar to what they posted on their website.  So it is  me who has to pay for stupid over delayed orders return transport. ..this is highly unfair and unpleasant! It is not the first time this happened. Silly me cuz i made a new order and didnt learn my lesson. Dont make the same mistake i did...

            ASOS really need to review their own customer service. They used to be quite a good company but now it feels like they really don't care once they have your money. Maybe they have got too big, too fast. Based on my previous good experiences, I bought a gift voucher for friend, and without going into reams of details, the friend could not redeem it. It soon became a chore for her, and she gave up in frustration.  It was then left to me to try to get a refund. Weeks and weeks later I now have a refund but only after emailing (x 8), online chat (x2), calling (x1). There has been no acknowledgement by ASOS of the work and expense they cause, let alone the disappoinment. And their customer service is glib. As if they've all been on a training course about ways to pacify complainants by pretending to be your best friend with mock empathy, and it's all very cynical. Would never order from them again.

            In December I ordered some clothes for my Christmas holidays. The delivery date was quoted as well before my holiday, so I confirmed the order. The order didn't arrive and then over the next two weeks I chased its status with the customer service team and through their order tracker. The customer service team told me to contact the delivery contractor myself as they were unable to do so. I found out that the shipment had been shipped back to the destination, with no sign of a delivery being attempted. When I contacted ASOS to ask why this had happened and when I would receive a refund, I was given no explanation, was fobbed off, and was told that it would take a further 21 days for the order to get back to the warehouse, plus 24 hours for the refund to be processed, and then a further 5-10 days for the refund to clear in my bank account.A month later I am still chasing the refund and my order query has been closed so I can't contact anyone.Absolutely terrible customer service, I remain unconfident that I will see my money again and will never use ASOS again.

            Wow. My experience with ASOS has been the worst cystomer service experience. I would never in a million years recommend this company to anyone. It was my first time ordering with them (will be my last) for some maternity clothes. I needed the items by a certain date as I was traveling, and THEIR customer service agent told me via chat to upgrade the shipping method and I would get the items before I left. Otherwise, I would have selected the standard shipping and received them at my destination. Well, the items were late by four day and and I had to chase them and contact sky net to figure out where the parcel was and arrange a delivery to someone else as ASOS refused to reroute, refund or send another package. This process took two days and about 4 hours out of my life.  In fact their agent suggested I spend another $250 and reorder everything if I wanted my clothes, that's WITHOUT them refunding me for the first order which I hadn't received. Why would I give you another $250 when you couldn't deliver the first $250?! They promised to refund me the express shipping which I have yet to see as it doesn't appear on my card and they blocked my account. Again, inquiring as to why 5 times did not make anyone respond to me. They sponsor bloggers to recommend their site but, buyer beware!!!! Definitely not a legitimate company with a proper customer service, they're agents are unprofessional, rude and unhelpful.

I SHOULD QUIT MY JOB AND JUST DROP BY THE POSTAL MAIL FOR THE SAME ANSWER = without a tracking number we cant help you?)after long negotiating i was assured a new item will be shipped immediately and via express mail and i shall hear from customer service withing 48 hours.on 31/1/2016 i contact the customer care via chat, i'm repeating my complaint over and over again for the past hour, and jean from the customer care tell me ""I'm sorry if you received incorrect information"", that's literally apologizing not for the mistakes that has been conducted by asos but rather that i just received false information and i should accept it ?!am I contacting 3 different companies? or is it fair for the customer to wait another 2 weeks for nothing ?? because again without a tracking number i will not be able to receive anything I'm just wasting my time!By FAR Asos.com offer the worst and most horrible customer experience i have encountered !customers are neglected, customer care is horrible and not helpful, communication is messed up.

            I have purchased a pair of shoes that was supposed to be delivered a few days ago, so I emailed. I got a reply with someone else's name. Anyway I replied as the email requested to confirm my order number and the delivery address. Then the second email came, still someone else's name on it. Only told me that the item was supposed to be delivered by this day and wait for another week and then email back to them. On their site, they say email customer case if we don't receive the item by the estimated delivery date ? So it's was totally a waste of my time and now I'm still keep checking the tracking which has no update for 10 days after the item had arrived in my local town.Now I'm not sure if I really enjoy the item anymore even if I received. It worries me what service I get next.

            We received an item that was falling apart at the bottom of the zipper/seam. I couldn't find a phone # anywhere so I started a chat. One of the security questions was my birthdate which is quite fishy. Then they said they didn't believe me that the item was faulty and the only way they would refund/ credit me was to first get an invoice from a tailor. There weren't anymore in stock and my daughter liked the item. So, I thought I would go to the trouble of fixing it myself and receive a partial credit for damage. Any other decent company would do this without hesitation. No matter what I said, ASOS would not budge. After all of this, I will just return it. It wasn't that cheap and I'm disgusted.

            I had a very bad experience with ASOS.com. Think the company is fishy...- I placed an order for a dress and was confirmed instantly as usual. - Few hours after I received cancellation email stating that they need copies of my identification and credit card statement.- Received email saying that they will get back to be within 2 working days after I sent the documents. I blocked my CC number in the statement ex the last 4 digits.- After 2 working days, I still hadn't heard anything from ASOS so I sent them another email.- They get back to me requiring a scan of CC, which is ridiculous. - Throughout the ordeal, they also blocked my account.

He also informed me that the package will be send back to the company. Almost an hour later I receive a text message - your parcel will be delivered today.

I chat with the customer service trying to say that it is not acceptable as imagine I would go home and wait for the package that would not be delivered.

Imagine my surprise, when next day, the guy try to deliver the package to me, stating that he wasn't aware that the order been cancelled!

            I have ordered two pairs of jeans from them. The fist pair were too small, so I sent them back with the free return label. They refunded me in less than two weeks which is very fast when compared to most sites. The second pair of jeans I ordered are probably my favorite pair of jeans I own. The quality of their own denim brand is a lot better than people say online and is, in my opinion, better quality and more comfortable than many ""big name"" denim brands.

            They listen to their customers and will do something when you're not happy. I ordered a pair of boots and I received the wrong size and in the first instance they told me I could send it back if I paid for the shipping myself. But I explained to them it was a mistake in the app that converted the size from EU to UK incorrectly. So then I could send them back for free. And now they even have occasional free returns which means they really do want to know what their customers have to say!

            I used to love Asos and ordered frequently from this website for a couple of years.  They have a huge variety of products (clothes, shoes, and accessories) from various brands, including its own eponymous line.  The Asos brand is inexpensive, so its frequent use of synthetic fabrics and its somewhat derivative designs aren't unexpected. In spite of that, the clothes are very fashionable and reasonably well-made.  I have several pieces that have held up well through various washings and still look fine after a year or two of use.  Shipping is free if you spend only $40 on the site, and it's usually extremely quick, even though the items usually come from Asos' fulfillment overseas. Typically, it would never take more than a week for an Asos package to reach me.  Unfortunately, I ordered some maternity clothes for a weekend trip to NYC this Fall, and the items were inexplicably held up in Customs.  Because I needed the items by a certain date, and because I was quickly outgrowing my regular clothes and was in desperate need of maternity dresses, I pressed customer service a bit when two weeks passed without my items arriving by the PROMISED date.  (Because the holidays were approaching, Asos listed guaranteed delivery dates on its website, and I was relying on the date I was given.  In fact, I had even given myself a cushion of several days ""just in case."")  I was told that they would contact their carrier but that it would take 48 hours for them to get a response.  I wasn't happy with this, since it meant that I would not receive the clothes I had ordered by the date of my trip, but I let it slide.  These things happen, and it sounded like a problem with their third-party carrier rather than with Asos.  I worked customer service jobs in college, and I know when things are out of a customer service rep's hands, so I just waited the two days.  Well, those 48 hours passed, and then I contacted customer service again.  And then again.  Each time I contacted them, I was told it would take an additional 48 hours to get a response from their carrier.  At no time was a solution EVER offered.  Even after I began to get angry and started to communicate to the customer service reps how inconvenient the situation was becoming (again, I was in my second trimester and rapidly outgrowing my clothes and really, really wanted to the cute, affordable dresses I had taken over an hour shopping for, and for which I had already paid, with the expectation that they would be delivered by the date PROMISED on Asos' website), they just kept repeating like a broken record that it would take an additional 48 hours to get a response.  It was quite clear that the package was lost, and that with the holidays rapidly approaching it was likely that their carrier was overwhelmed and was not responding to their inquiries, and yet I was repeatedly told just to wait.  With holiday parties upon me, I wanted a couple of cute dresses to wear, but Asos customer service showed absolutely no urgency to help.  They did not offer to replace the lost merchandise with another, expedited shipment.  They did not offer a discount on my next purchase for the massive inconvenience I was experiencing.  Nothing.  When I asked if I should just demand a refund, the rep's response was a lazy, indifferent, ""If that's what you want.  We'll just divert the package back to us and give you your money.""  Never mind that I had been waiting several weeks at that point, that I had taken the time to pick out those specific items, never mind that I was a loyal, paying customer with a history of shopping on their site for a few years.  When I expressed disappointment at their lackadaisical response, another customer service rep emailed me back with a lavish apology and an explicit promise to get a resolution of the issue immediately.  (""I will not rest until we've resolved this"" were his exact words).  I contacted them a couple of days later and was told - yep - that their carrier had not yet responded and so they would reach out to them again, and again I would have to wait ANOTHER 48 hours.  This loop would have continued ad infinitum if I hadn't just pulled the plug and demanded a refund.  I got my money back promptly but was completely disgusted.  After that experience, I just can't recommend this site to anyone.  It has its benefits, but keep in mind that if you have a problem, you will be offered no solution whatsoever.  A quick update:  Though I vowed never to shop there again, I've gotten tired of over-paying for dowdy, often poorly made maternity clothes from other websites and department stores, so yesterday I dipped my toe back into Asos' pond and ordered a cute dress that I intend to wear to my shower.  We'll see what happens.

            It’s very hit and miss with ASOS. Purely because their items of clothing are perfectly pinned to  the models, and it makes them look fantastic. But when you order and finally receive it – the quality is just average and their sizing’s are not always true. For example: A size 8 is far too small sometimes.Another issue I have with ASOS- is that they don’t really have a customer services team you could contact via phone. ASOS- As seen on screen – is exactly that. Everything is done online, including their customer services. Which can be frustrating when you are looking for an immediate answer. Their returns process is not fantastic either- you worry if your return will even get to them with the “free” return postage, and if you don’t have your receipt you’re basically out of pocket (if they never got your return).The final issue I have, is that ASOS knows that stock runs low (particularly for sizes 6,8 and 10) and because they run out of stock so quickly – they hardly replenish the stock. Meaning you are left having to browse other styles in the end because there is no clarity as to if what you wanted will be back in stock or been discontinued.

            I ordered gift vouchers which were supposed to be delivered days ago via email. After numerous customer service representatives advising me to wait 24 hours, I have now been told they have been sent and they take upto 72 hours to reach my inbox. To try and persuade me an email takes that long in this day and age is ridiculous. Thanks asos, I have missed my friends birthday and wasted a lot of time with no resolution to my problem.

            I am so dissapointed in ASOS. I have a premier delivery account which you pay extra for. I placed an order on tuesday and asked for a next day delivery which i was granted. right now it's 11pm on Saturday and i still don't have my order. Everyday i've emailed them and everyday somone different responds ever so apologetically with some sob story and how they have rectified it and yet nothing changes.Last time i had even worse issues, wrong address again, wrong colour of item, and customer service Rep argued with me trying to say there's no way they could have sent me the wrong item. even though i took a photo and and the tag on the item proved it wasn't the one I wanted.Guess i have to stick to SSENSE, more expensive but more sensible..

            My order was faulty, also they must enhance the colour on their photos as the item was a lot less vibrant so I informed asos, they asked did I want a refund or replacement. I asked for a replacement. Four days later they email me saying the item is now out of stock. It wasn't out of stock when I requested the exchange. Their excuse was the order had to be processed and the item went out of stock whilst the order was being processed. First of all I have already bought the item and waited for the item to be processed, this is not a new order, they sold me a faulty item so should  exchange straight away and certainly not put me to the back of the queue and process the order again! They also told me I should have bought a second item whilst it was still in stock so basically ordering and paying for two! I now have to wait up to 13 days for a refund! Just awful, will not be using asos again!

            Hi!I have been a customer for 10 years and always loved ASOS. Every birthday I got vouchers and a ""Happy Birthday"" making me feel appreciated as a customer. One day it stopped and so did their good customer service. I recently purchased a big order and when I received my order I only got one package. When I opened it half was missing and I contacted ASOS the minute after the delivery guy left. What do ASOS do? They want to have proof of the signatures AND asks me to contact them later. Throughout two days I had to contact them again and again and NO ONE followed it up. I them met the delivery man and he said to me he found the parcel in the van and had no information there were two parcels. Okay, so I email ASOS and ask them to refund my money for the next day delivery because I choose to use it instead of the 10% off student discount because I needed the products fast. At the same time ASOS comes out with a 20% off discount which I have troubles using and I once again contact them, and they will not do anything about it. I then ask Mark in the customer service if he knows if they have trustpilot. He tells me he doesn't know. Do the people who work at ASOS have no interest or information about their own employer. To have trustpilot, which is a quite big website, the company itself have to pay for it and I would expect that the people employed would know. The overall experience with the customer service is that they doesn't know anything nor have any training to offer any service at all.

            well i have read reviews here and while my english is not really good but i decided to write my opinion here too asos is first and only online shop that i have bough dresses , and at first when i saw the negative comments i was worried , but their cute dresses , and low prices , and different options for sizes and the easy app and possibility to watch the catwalk .. made me try and shop here .. when i got my first dress , the good quality/material and being as cute as the picture and receiving it on time made me stay their customer !! a happy one :)about quality always remember you get what you pay for , and i still think the compare of the quality and the price , quality is really fine ..and bad things are possible to happen too but you can solve it with their costumer service ..i once got a dress which it was a bit damage , it made me not happy but be fair , it can always happen , and two times the dresses were not really fit me and suit me , so i tried to contact the customer service via the site and Facebook , they were answering me really fast , and they were really helpful and friendly ,so i sent those dresses back and i got the refund , sooner than what i was expecting , and from Netherland the return to Uk was for  free so nothing to complain ,..oh and my paracel arrived always on time . well im happy about everything of this site , hope you will have same experience as mine :)

            Roughly half my recent orders have gone wrong, either becuase items haven't been delivered or when they have, have just been dumped outside in awful weather. When you contact ASOS to complain, especially about items which haven't been delivered, their only suggestion is to place another order and then return one for a refund i.e spend double the amount of money with them and hope the missing items finally appears to then go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a refund.So many of their competitors get it right - I know I'll be shopping with them instead of ASOS in the future.

            By far my favourite online retailer. Been shopping here since 2011 for items ranging from clothes to beauty to electricals. It has been a pleasure and has changed shopping for me forever (no more stuffy poorly lit changing rooms).In short, I have made 100s of orders over the past 5 years and the items have always arrived on time in pristine condition and well packaged. I can truly say no other retailer has reached this standard.Returns are easy and swift. When I, rarely, run into a problem it is resolved within hours with polite customer service.I would thoroughly recommend and have definitely passed the ASOS shopping bug to my friends and family.

            First time using ASOS, ordered a shirt for my fiancé that I have been waiting for to become 'restocked' on their website so he can wear in our engagement photos. I paid extra for faster shipping as well. Very fast with delivery and excited I received it on time. Opened the package, completely wrong shirt.No big deal, I got in contact with them and returned the item. They said they will ship me the correct item as soon as possible with the new shipping number. 3 days later, nothing. I re-contacted them and they said it takes over 72hrs if it is in stock. Ok I guess... waited another 3 days contacted them again, this time through their 'chat' and they said there was a glitch in the system and it had not been processed for shipment so it will take another 24-72hr. Honestly I was so over the run around and just wanted a refund. The customer service rep said ""OK, just returned the 'wrong' item back to us and you will get your money back, have a good day""....Glad you guys care! first and last time, thank you!

            I brought a coat in these Winter conditions. My first order they send a faulty item. I think to myself it's fine it happens.I resend the coat, and they send out a replacement. Now this replacement is the wrong size due to their error. Now I have to wait for this replacement to resend it but they mess up the delivery. They send it via DPD to a shop not my address. I used the shop via their Collect+ service. So not only are the customer service team incompetent at knowing they own delivery service, they cannot look at my address.It's clearly on the system. Imagine my frustration when I'm looking point blank at the address on My Account and the customer care team claiming I have a different address on my account.I have to get that returned, then order it new. So as it stands, they have 2 coats sent back to them, and I have to wait 7 days to get the refund. Now they send a 3rd coat which is the wrong item. So I'm £100 out of pocket, with the wrong coat. There's no number to call ASOS either. You have to go through the same tedious process of explaining your situation over and over.

            I did not receive my order, and ASOS  have refused to refund my payment or send a replacement. They work with DPD and in the past orders have been signed for by the drivers, and left outside the house without any cards to notify where the package has been left. This time they claimed the package had been signed for, and they cannot do anything about it.UPDATE - Over 5 weeks later, still no products received, no refund and lots of time wasted. I have been emailing back and forth every few days. Even after finding out that the signature taken for this package does not match my signature from another DPD delivery, they said that there is nothing they can do about it. Absolute rubbish, I won't be purchasing again.

First the expected arrival date was 18/12 then they emailed and said wait till 5/1/2016 when the package didn't arrive by 18/12/2015. And finally now they say they'll send the items which are in stock to me but I've to wait for them to arrive by 27/1/2016. I can't even have an upgraded delivery service as they ""were unable to do so"" as they stated in the email reply. I can't believe I have to wait so Long. And when I emailed them asking on several occasions, the customer service kept sending standard replies (seemingly from a template) asking me to check my delivery address, ask my neighbors if they say the parcel, etc. It's really disappointing that an established online shopping site like ASOS does not try to look from the customer's point of view Nor take steps for service recovery to help ease the customer's frustrations.

            I ordered a top in a size 16 they sent me out a size 8 then said they will fix it but they can't because the top I bought is out of stock. I should have got this as I paid for it when it was in stock!! Very poor customer service!!!

            I seriously love ASOS. I recommend it to everyone!! I make atleast 15-20 purchases a year on ASOS and wish I could make more. Their sizing is so consistent - so much so that they've even spoiled me to expecting the same from other retailers which is not the case. I have made returns because they do offer free returns so I tend to order alot and then maybe rethink it afterwards. Never had a problem with returns. In the one instance where I did not receive confirmation of my return, I reached out and they issued my refund within a couple of days. Their quality is great and I received my order before the holidays in perfect timing. Not sure about all these negative reviews, perhaps location matters? I live in NY and I've been fortunate with all of my deliveries from ASOS. Highly highly recommend!!!!

            Hello everyone!I bought a bag on November 11 and when it arrived a month later (!!! I live in Greece not the North Pole) it wasnt the one i had bought. Oh well! I thought. Mistakes are for humans....so i send them an email explaining the problem and i too sent pictures, one of the bag i wanted and one of the one i got (this is crucial). Kind apologies and reassurements that they got it and would send the correct item to me. (Which i wanted for Christmas, but what the fairy...it is Christmas after all...) Yesterday i got the SAME BAG from them. You know , the one i said i didnt want... It wasnt expensive but it was a good bargain and i REALLY wanted it. Ever since summer the services prices shipping products and the whole experience has taken a turn for the worse. Shipping was always bad and things tend to get lost very often on the way to me but i always got replacements. And i have received wrong or faulty items often enough for my liking. I used to buy very often for six years from them but i am not happy anymore. The experience is just not the same and i guess i am frustrated not knowing whether i will receive the item and if it will be the one i bought. I must say though that they always are very helpful and willing to help. I feel safe in that aspect.i hope this helps

            I ordered products for Christmas and they confirmed that I would get them 5 days before Christmas Eve. Today on january 4 I still haven't got them and there is no track and trace info on the package. No Christmas presents for my kids and no clear answer about when they can expect to get them. My advice: Asos has some good product but dont use them is you have a fixed delievery date

            I ordered a dress before Christmas and paid extra for express shipping, as the site stated it would arrive on or before the 31st of December (I wanted to wear it for my birthday which was 2 days ago). Still waiting... I haven't paid express before and I won't again, what a waste of money! I understand it is a busy Christmas period but please don't put on your site that it will arrive before a certain date and charge extra, when it never does!

            ASOS sucks. I placed an order and paid for the $29 2-day shipping. My order is scheduled for delivery 10 days from the order date. Contacted Customer Service and they tell me I still need to select Express Shipping somewhere and my order clearly shows I selected the 2-day option. I even sent them a photo of the order. They still say it's may fault and ""too bad"".

            I ordered a coat that I fell in love with and when it arrived it was not as described. No hook and closures. They said that the description   did not say that, and I sent them the copy. I countered saying that I loved the coat, but it would cost me 20 dollars to have proper closures put in. They said they could not refund me  the money, for me just to return the coat. I counter offered saying give me a 20 dollar STORE CREDIT, that I had my eye on something else for 100 so it would be 80 dollars. They said no. I think because it is a UK site that they really don't get what customer service is all about. So I'm returning the coats, the boots and the poncho all adding up to 300 dollars   plus the potential of buying something else. They would rather lose a long time customer. No wonder their stock  is tanking.

            I've always been a happy costumer ordering from ASOS. Until now...I ordered a pair of shoes a week before Christmas to wear at Christmas eve. Instead I got sent a dress in a size XS. I contacted costumer service and they told me to send the dress back and said they would send me the shoes I ordered in the first place. Now I got an email saying the item is out of stock. Not going to order from ASOS again. This is just not okay.

            I have ordered a jumpsuit which was suppose to arrive within 10 days. On 08th day after contacting them i got to know that it has been returned by the delivery provider because of no reason. My product was returned without even contacting me. And when i contacted the customer service team of ASOS they have given me 3 different reasons. First they said that they require the photo identity then they said they require me to pay more for custom charges (there were none) then they said it has been returned because of their technical fault. The product never came to me and has been returned by their delivery company. Nobody contacted me ever to deliver the product. This is the worst online shopping experience i had. and icing on the cake is their customer service team which is useless. they keep on sending the automated reply even if you try contacting them for help. My suggestion not to buy anything from ASOS your money will be stuck.
